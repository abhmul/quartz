# Description
A subfield of math that studies the foundations of mathematics. It rigorously formulates the notions of a mathematical language, formal logic, and proofs. Using these formalisms, it proves results about [[Logical Soundness]] and [[Logical Completeness]] of these systems.

I found it odd to talk about math fundamentally, and talk about [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory|set theory]], using [[Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory|set theory]]. It felt very circular. The way I've come to understand it is that we are really proving things about these formal structures (e.g. [[Language]]s and [[Model]]s). Because these structures apply to various different mathematical theories, we have now proven things about those theories.
