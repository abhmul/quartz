title: "Simple Path"

# Definition
Suppose $G$ is a [[Directed Graph]] ([[Undirected Graph]]) and suppose $P$ is a [[Graph Path|path]] on $G$ with [[Path Length]] $|P| = n$. Then $P$ is a [[Simple Path]] if $\not \exists i < j \in [n+1]$ so that $V(P)_{i} = V(P)_{j}$. That is, no [[Graph Vertex]] is repeated on $P$.

## Examples
1. The [[Empty Tuple]] is a [[Simple Path]] from any [[Graph Vertex]] to itself.
