title: "Product Topological Space"

---
# Definition
Let $I$ be a [[Nonempty]] [[Index Set]] and let $\{X_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[Set|collection]] of [[Topological Space]]s. Then the [[Product Topological Space]] on $\prod\limits_{i \in I} X_{i}$ is the [[Topology Generated by a Set|topology generated by the set]]
$$\mathcal{B} := \{\pi_{i}^{-1}(U_{i}) : U_{i} \subset X_{i} \text{ is open}, i \in I\}$$
where $\pi_{i}$ is the [[Projection Map]] $X \to X_{i}$ defined as $x \mapsto x_{i}$.

## Remarks
1. [[TODO]] - *what is this saying? Should be stating $\mathcal{B}'$ is a [[Topological Basis]], but looks like gibberish right now. Move to [[Product of Finitely Many Proper Open Sets form a Basis for the Product Topology]].* By [[The Topology Generated by a Set has a Basis of Finite Intersections]], we know the [[Product Topological Space]]  has [[Topological Basis|basis]]$$\tau := \{\prod\limits_{i \in I} U_{i} : U_{i} \subset X_{i} \text{ is open}, \text{ only finitely many }U_{i} \neq X_{i}, i \in I\}$$ since $\prod\limits_{i \in I} U_{i} =\bigcap\limits_{i \in I, U_{i} \neq X_{i}} \pi_{i}^{-1}(U_{i})$ and only finitely many [[Open]] $U_{i} \neq X_{i}$.
