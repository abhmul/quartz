An [[Oracle Government]] is a [[Governmental System]] such that whenever the citizens face a major problem, they go to an oracle device to get an answer for what they should do. It is a reference to how ancient Romans used to use oracles such as animals to decide what to do. They looked at the actions of these oracles as messages from the Gods. We could do something more sophisticated, but in the same vein.

For example, consider a [[Crowdsourcing Oracle]]. The [[Crowdsourcing Oracle]] will present the problem along with relevant details to [[Uniform Distribution|uniformly random]] individuals in the population (or outside the population). These individuals vote on decisions and the result comes back to the citizens, telling them what to do. We could even make the [[Crowdsourcing Oracle]] [[Algorithm]] more sophisticated by allowing the chosen crowdmembers to further crowdsource their own questions about the issue.
