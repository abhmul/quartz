title: "Almost Everywhere Pointwise Convergence"
---

# Definition
Suppose $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$ is a [[Measure Space]] and $(Y, \tau)$ is a [[Topological Space]]. Suppose $(f_{n})$ is a [[Sequence]] of [[Function]]s from $X$ to $Y$ and suppose $f: X \to Y$. If there exists a set $N \subset X$ so that
1. $\mu(N) = 0$
2. $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} f_{n}(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in N^{C}$.

then we say $f_{n}$ [[Almost Everywhere Pointwise Convergence|converges pointwise almost everywhere]] to $f$.
