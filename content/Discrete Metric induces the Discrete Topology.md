title: "Discrete Metric induces the Discrete Topology"

---
# Statement
Let $S$ be a [[Set]] equipped with the [[Discrete Metric]], $d$. Then the [[Metric Topology]] induced by $d$ is the [[Discrete Topology]] on $S$.

## Proof
Observe that $B_{1}(x) = \{x\}$ is a [[Open]] in the [[Metric Topology]] for all $x \in X$. Thus, the [[Metric Topology]] contains all the singletons. Then the [[Metric Topology]] contains the [[Discrete Topology]]. Since the [[Discrete Topology]] is the finest possible [[Topological Space]], the [[Metric Topology]] here must be the [[Discrete Topology]]. $\blacksquare$
