title: "Augmenting Path Theorem of Matchings"
---

# Statement
Suppose $G = (V, E)$ is an [[Undirected Graph]] and $M$ is a [[Matching]] on $G$. Then $M$ is a [[Maximum Matching]] on $G$ [[If and Only If]] there is no $M$-[[Matching Augmenting Path|augmenting path]].

## Proof
[[TODO]] - See [[Cook - Combinatorial Optimization]] page 129 for details.
