# Definition
A [[Hypercube]] is a [[Set]] of the form $\{0, 1\}^{n}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$

## Remarks
### Other forms
[[Hypercube]]s have many more forms they may be represented in based on circumstances. Below are some examples:
- $\{\pm 1\}^{n}$
- $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$
- $\{\text{True}, \text{False}\}$

All forms carry the same basic concept and are amenable to the same analysis techniques.
