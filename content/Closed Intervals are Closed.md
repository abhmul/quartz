title: "Closed Intervals are Closed"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] equipped with the [[Order Topology]]. Then the following [[Set]]s are [[Closed]]:
1. $[a,b]$ for all $a, b \in X$ so $a \leq b$.
2. $(\leftarrow, a]$ and $[a, \rightarrow)$ for all $a \in X$
3. $X$ itself

## Proof
(3) follows from the definition of a [[Topological Space]] $\checkmark$. 

Note $(\leftarrow, a]^{C} = (a, \rightarrow)$ and $[a, \rightarrow)^{C} = (\leftarrow, a)$ for all $a \in X$. Because [[Open Ray]]s [[Topology Generated by a Set|generate]] the [[Order Topology]], we know they are [[Open]], showing that the [[Closed Ray]]s are [[Closed]] and (2) follows $\checkmark$.

(1) follows after noting that for $a,b \in X$ so $a \leq b$, $[a,b] = (\leftarrow, b] \cap [a, \rightarrow)$ and [[Intersection of Closed Sets is Closed]] $\checkmark$.  $\blacksquare$
