title: "Liminf of Indicator Sequence is Indicator of Liminf"

---
# Statement
Let $({A}_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty} \subset X$ be a [[Sequence]] of [[Set]]s. Then
$$\liminf\limits_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{1}_{A_{n}} = \mathbb{1}_{\liminf\limits_{n \to \infty} A_{n}}.$$
## Proof
[[TODO]] similar to [[Limsup of Indicator Sequence is Indicator of Limsup]]
