title: "Topology Generated by a Set"

---
# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Set]] and let $B \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$. Then we define $\tau(B)$, the [[Topology Generated by a Set]] as
$$\tau(B) := \bigcap\limits \{\tau \subset \mathcal{P}(X) : B \subset \tau, \tau \text{ is a topology on }X\}.$$
In other words, $\tau(B)$ is the "smallest" [[Topological Space]] containing $B$.

## Remarks
1. $\tau(B)$ is a [[Topological Space]] since [[Intersection of Structures is still a Structure]].
