title: "Path-Connected Components of Topological Manifolds are Open"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Manifold]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$. Then every [[Path-Connected Component]] $C \subset X$ is [[Open]].

## Proof
[[Topological Manifolds are Locally Path-Connected]] and [[Path-Connected Components of Locally Path-Connected Spaces are Open]]. $\blacksquare$
