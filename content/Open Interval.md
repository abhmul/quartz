title: "Open Interval"

---
# Definition
Let $(T, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]].  An [[Open Interval]] is $(a,b)$ for $a \leq b \in T$ is the [[Set]]
$$(a,b) := \{x \in T : a < x < b\}$$
## Remarks
1. $(a, a) = \emptyset$ for $a \in T$.
2. Sometimes, when referring to an [[Open Interval]], we may include [[Open Ray]]s and $T$ itself.
