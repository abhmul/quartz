---
# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. We say $X$ is [[Second Countable]] if there exists a [[Countable]] [[Topological Basis]] for $X$.

## Examples
1. One major example is [[Euclidean Space is Second Countable]].
2. A simple nonexample is $\mathbb{R}$ equipped with the [[Discrete Topology]]
