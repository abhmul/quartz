title: "Distribution"

Suppose $X$ is a [[Random Variable]] on [[Probability Space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{M}, \mathbb{P})$ with [[Distribution Function]] $F_{X}$ and [[Induced Probability Measure]] $\mu$. The [[Distribution]] is really just an overloaded shorthand for these two terms. That is, if $G$ is the [[Distribution]] then

1. $G(x) = F_{X}(x)$ $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$
2. $G(S) = \mu(S)$ $\forall S \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$
