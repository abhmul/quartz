title: "Completeness of the Real Numbers"

# Statement
We can state this in the following 6 ways all of which are equivalent:
1. $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual [[Total Ordering]] $\leq$ is a [[Complete Ordering]]
2. Every [[Cauchy Sequence]] of $\mathbb{R}$ [[Sequence Convergence|converges]] in $\mathbb{R}$.
3. $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the [[Nested Intervals Theorem]]
4. $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the [[Bounded Monotone Convergence Theorem]].
5. $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the [[Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem]].
6. $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]]

# Completing $\mathbb{R}$
## Approach 1: Completion by [[Cauchy Sequence]]s
[[TODO]] In this approach we define a notion of [[Cauchy Sequence]]s on $\mathbb{Q}$ and represent $\mathbb{R}$ as [[Cauchy Sequence]]s on $\mathbb{Q}$.
