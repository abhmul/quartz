title: "Axiom"

# Definition
This is more of a conceptual [[Object]] rather than a rigorously defined [[Object]]. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a [[Language]]. We call an $\mathcal{L}$-[[Sentence]] $\phi$ an [[Axiom]] when it is part of a [[Theory]] for some [[Elementary Class]]. Usually we give the [[Elementary Class]] a name (e.g. [[Group]]).
