title: "Ordered Pair"

---
# Definition
Let $x, y$ be two [[Set]]s. Then the [[Ordered Pair]] $(x, y)$ is defined as the [[Set]] $\{\{x\}, \{x, y\}\}$.

## Proof of Existence
$\{x, y\}$ exists as per the [[Axiom of Pairing]]. $\{x\}$ exists as well as per the [[Axiom of Pairing]] (pairing $x$ and $x$). Thus $\{\{x\}, \{x, y\}\}$ exists as per the [[Axiom of Pairing]]. $\blacksquare$
