title: "Homogenous Linear System"

---
# Definition 1
Let $F$ be a [[Field]], let $n, m \in \mathbb{N}$. Then we call an [[Equation System]] of the form

$$\begin{align*}
a_{11} x_{1} + \dots a_{1n} x_{n} &= 0\\
.\\
.\\
.\\
a_{m1} x_{1} + \dots a_{mn} x_{n} &= 0
\end{align*}$$
a [[Homogenous Linear System]] of the [[Equation Variable]]s $x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}$.

# Definition 2
Let $V, W$ be [[Vector Space]]s over [[Field]] $F$. A [[Homogenous Linear System]] from $V$ to $W$ is a [[Linear Equation System]] that is also a [[Homogenous Equation System]].

## Remarks
1. Definition 1 is the usual definition seen in books and on the internet, while definition 2 is my more general definition.
