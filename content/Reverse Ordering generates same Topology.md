title: "Reverse Ordering generates same Topology"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] with the [[Order Topology]]. Let $\leq'$ be the [[Reverse Ordering]] on $X$. Then $(X, \leq')$ has the same [[Order Topology]] as $(X, \leq)$.

## Proof
We must simply check that they are [[Topology Generated by a Set|generated by]] the same collection. Indeed for any $c \in X$, we have $(c, \rightarrow)_{\leq} = ( \leftarrow, c)_{\leq'}$  and $( \leftarrow, c)_{\leq} = (c, \rightarrow)_{\leq'}$. $\blacksquare$

## Remarks
1. Another way to state this is the [[Identity Function]] is a [[Homeomorphism]] between a [[Total Ordering]] and its [[Reverse Ordering]].
