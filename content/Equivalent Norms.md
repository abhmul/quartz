title: "Equivalent Norms"

---
# Definition
Let $(X, ||\cdot||)$ be a [[Normed Vector Subspace]] and let $Y \subset X$ be a [[Vector Subspace]] equipped with [[Norm]] $|||\cdot|||$. We say $||\cdot||$ is [[Equivalent Norms|equivalent]] to $|||\cdot|||$ if they are both [[Stronger Norm|stronger]] than the other.

## Remarks
1. [[Equivalent Norms define Homeomorphic Spaces]]
