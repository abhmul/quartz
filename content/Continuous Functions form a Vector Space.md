title: "Continuous Functions form a Vector Space"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]],  and let $V$ be a [[Topological Vector Space]] over [[Topological Field]] $F$. Then $C(X, V)$ forms a [[Vector Space]] over $F$.

## Proof
Recall [[Functions to a Vector Space form a Vector Space]]. Therefore, we only need to check $C(X, V)$ is a [[Vector Subspace]]. Let $c \in F$ and $f,g \in C(X, V)$. Then, because [[Composition of Continuous Functions is Continuous]] and $V,F$ is a [[Topological Vector Space]] and [[Topological Field]] respectively, we have $c * f + g \in C(X, V)$. Therefore $C(X, V)$ is a [[Vector Subspace]] of $V^{X}$, and thus a [[Vector Space]] in its own right. $\blacksquare$
