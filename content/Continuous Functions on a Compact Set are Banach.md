title: "Continuous Functions on a Compact Set are Banach"

---
# Statement
Let $K$ be a [[Compact]] [[Topological Space]] and suppose $(Y, |\cdot|)$ is a [[Banach Space]] over $\mathbb{K}$. Then $C(K, Y)$, the space of [[Continuous Function]]s, is a [[Banach Space]] over $\mathbb{K}$ when equipped with the [[Supremum Norm]].

## Proof
Observe that for $f,g \in C(K, Y)$ and $c \in \mathbb{K}$, we have that $cf + g \in C(K, Y)$ because [[TODO]]
