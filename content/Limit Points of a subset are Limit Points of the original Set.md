title: "Limit Points of a subset are Limit Points of the original Set"
---

# Statement
Suppose $(X, \tau)$ is a [[Topological Space]] and let $T \subset S \subset X$. Then if $x \in X$ is a [[Limit Point]] of $T$, it is also a [[Limit Point]] of $S$.

## Proof
Suppose $U \subset X$ [[Open]] so that $x \in U$. Then $U \cap S \supset U \cap T \neq \emptyset$ and $x$ is a [[Limit Point]] of $S$. $\blacksquare$
