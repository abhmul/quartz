title: "Closure"

# Definition
Let $X, \tau$ be a [[Topological Space]] and let $S \subset X$. Then the [[Closure]] of $S$, denoted $\text{cl}S$ is

$$\text{cl}S := \bigcap\limits \{K \subset X : K \supset S, K \text{ is closed in } X\}$$

## Properties
1. $\text{cl} S$ is [[Closed]] in $X$ since an [[Intersection of Closed Sets is Closed]]
2. $\text{cl}S = \bar{S} := \bigcup\limits \{x \in X : x \text{ is a limit point of } S\}$. That is, [[Closure of a Set is all its Limit Points]].

2. $\text{cl}S = X \setminus \text{int} S^{C}$
