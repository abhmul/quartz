title: "Sphere is Closed"

---
# Statement
Let $(M, d)$ be a [[Metric Space]]. Let $x \in M$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Then $S_\epsilon(x)$ is [[Closed]].

## Proof
[[Closed Ball is Closed]] and $S_{\epsilon}(x) = \overline{B_{\epsilon}(x)} \setminus B_{\epsilon}(x) = \overline{B_{\epsilon}(x)} \cap B_{\epsilon}(x)^{C}$. $\blacksquare$
