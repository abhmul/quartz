title: "Quotient Norm"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, ||\cdot||)$ be a [[Normed Vector Space]] and let $Y \subset X$ be a [[Closed]] [[Vector Subspace]]. Then $||[\cdot]|| : X / Y \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ defined as 
$$||[x]|| := \inf\limits_{y \in Y} ||x - y|| = \text{dist}\{x, Y\}$$
for $x \in X$ is a [[Norm]] on $X / Y$.

## Proof
[[TODO]]

## Remarks
1. The requirement that $Y$ is [[Closed]] is very important. See [StackExchange on why the subspace needs to be closed](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/68508/question-about-normed-vector-spaces-and-quotients).
