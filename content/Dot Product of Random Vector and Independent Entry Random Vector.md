title: "Dot Product of Random Vector and Independent Entry Random Vector"
---

# Statement
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{M}, \mathbb{P})$ be a [[Probability Space]]. Suppose $(X_n)$ is a [[Sequence]] of [[Random Variable]]s and $(Y_{n})$ is a [[Sequence]] of [[Independence|Independent]] [[Random Variable]]s that is also independent with $X_{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Denote 
$$\begin{align*}
&\mathbb{E}(X_{n}) = \mu_{n} & \mathbb{E}(Y_{n}) = \nu_{n}\\
&\text{Var}(X_{n})&a\\
&S_{n} = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} X_{n} Y_{n}\\
\end{align*}$$
