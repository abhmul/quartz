Welcome to my **math-wiki**! To get started check out 
- [[A Set is Closed iff it is its own Closure]].
- [[Conditional Expectation]]
- [[Vector Space]]
- [[Bayes Classifier]]

I've been building this *wiki* since early 2022 as a way to 
- review old material
- catalog my current mathematical knowledge
- draw connections I might have otherwise not noticed
- go down fun math rabbit holes

To familiarize yourself with my conventions, see [[House Rules and Conventions]]

**This is very much a WIP. Bear with me as I work out formatting and display kinks**
