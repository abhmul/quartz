title: "A Vector Space is Infinite-Dimensional iff there exists an Infinite Linearly Independent Set"

---
# Statement
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]]. Then $V$ is an [[Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space]] [[If and Only If]] there exists [[Linearly Independent]] $R \subset V$ so that $|R| = \infty$.

## Proof
Follows from [[A Vector Space is Infinite-Dimensional iff its Linearly Independent Set Size is Unbounded]] and [[Linearly Independent Set Size is Unbounded iff there exists an Infinite Linearly Independent Set]]. $\blacksquare$
