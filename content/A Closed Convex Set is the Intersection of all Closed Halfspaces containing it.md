title: "A Closed Convex Set is the Intersection of all Closed Halfspaces containing it"
---

# Statement
Let $V$ be an [[Inner Product Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ and $S \subset V$ be [[Closed]] and [[Convex Set|convex]]. Then $$S = \bigcap\limits_{} \{H \subset V : S \subset H, H \text{ is a closed halfspace}\}$$
## Proof
[[TODO]] - see [[Boyd - Convex Optimization]] section 2.5 pg 46
