title: "A Nonempty Set is Compact in the Order Topology iff it is Tightly Bounded and Complete"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] endowed with the [[Order Topology]]. Then [[Nonempty]] $K \subset X$ is [[Compact]] [[If and Only If]] $K$ is a [[Tightly Bounded Set]] and $(K, \leq {\big|}_{K^{2}})$ is a [[Complete Ordering]].

## Proof
$(\Rightarrow)$: Suppose [[Nonempty]] $K \subset X$ is [[Compact]]. Recall that [[Nonempty Compact Sets are Tightly Bounded]], so $K$ is a [[Tightly Bounded Set]]. Since [[The Order Topology on a Subset is the Subspace Topology]], we know $K$ equipped with the [[Subspace Topology]] is $(K, \leq {\big|}_{K^{2}})$ equipped the [[Order Topology]]. Therefore, the latter is [[Compact]]. Because [[Compact Spaces are Complete]], we have that $(K, \leq {\big|}_{K^{2}})$ is a [[Complete Ordering]] $\checkmark$.

$(\Leftarrow)$: Let $K \subset X$ be a [[Tightly Bounded Set]] so that $(K, \leq {\big|}_{K^{2}})$ is a [[Complete Ordering]] and let $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[Open Cover]] for $K$ with [[Index Set]] $I$. We know $\sup\limits K, \inf\limits K \in K$. Denote $a:= \inf\limits K$ and $b := \sup\limits K$. Let
$$S := \{x \in K : [a,x] \cap K  \text{ has a finite open subcover}\}.$$
$S$ is [[Nonempty]] since there exists $i_{0} \in I$ for which $a \in U_{i_{0}}$. Therefore, $\{a\} = [a,a] \cap K$ has a [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Open Subcover]] and $a \in S$. $S$ has $b \in K$ as an [[Upper Bound]] because $S \subset K = K \cap [a,b]$. Therefore, $\sup\limits S \in K$ exists. We claim two things
1. $\sup\limits S \in S$: Since $\sup\limits S \in K$, there is some $j_{0}$ so that $\sup\limits S \in U_{j_{0}}$. By [[Topology Generated by a Basis|construction]] of the [[Order Topology]], there is some [[Open Interval]] (or [[Open Ray]] or $X$) that is contained in $U_{j_{0}}$ and contains $\sup\limits S$. If it was $(\leftarrow, y)$ for some $y \in X$ (or $y = \rightarrow$), then $a \in (\leftarrow, y)$ (since $\sup\limits S \in (\leftarrow, y)$ and $\sup\limits S \geq a$). But this means $\{U_{j_{0}}\}$ is an [[Open Cover]] of $[a, \sup\limits S] \cap K$, so $\sup\limits S \in S$. Otherwise if the [[Open Interval]] in $U_{j_{0}}$ is $(x,y) \ni \sup\limits S$ for some $x \in X$ and $y \in X$ or $y = \rightarrow$, then because $x$ is not an [[Upper Bound]] of $S$ ($x < \sup\limits S$), there exists some $z \in S$ so that $x < z \leq \sup\limits S$. Combining $U_{j_{0}}$ with the finite open subcover for $[a,z] \cap K$, we get a finite open subcover for $[a, \sup\limits S]$. Therefore $\sup\limits S \in S$ $\checkmark$.
2. $\sup\limits S = b$: Suppose $\sup\limits S < b$. Let $\{U_{i_{1}}, \dots, U_{i_{n}}\}$ be a [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Open Subcover]] of $[a, \sup\limits S]$, with $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then [[Without Loss of Generality]], let $\sup\limits S \in U_{i_{1}}$. Then there exists some $(x,y) \subset U_{i_{1}}$ with $x \in X \cup \{\leftarrow\}$ and $y \in X \cup \{\rightarrow\}$ so that $\sup\limits S \in (x,y)$. We must have $y \leq b$, otherwise $b \in (x,y)$ and $\{U_{i_{1}}, \dots, U_{i_{n}}\}$ is a [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Open Subcover]] of $[a,b] \cap K$. Thus $y \in [a,b] \cap K$. Therefore there exists $U_{i_{n+1}}$ so that $y \in U_{i_{n+1}}$. But then $\{U_{i_{1}}, \dots, U_{i_{n+1}}\}$ forms a [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Open Subcover]] of $[a, y] \cap K$ and $y \in S$. But $y > \sup\limits S$ $\unicode{x21af}$.

These two points tell us that $b = \sup\limits S  \in S$ and $[a,b] \cap K = K$ admits a [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Open Subcover]]. Since our [[Open Cover]] was arbitrary, $K$ is [[Compact]] $\checkmark$. $\blacksquare$

## Proof 2
($\Rightarrow$) See Proof (1).

$(\Leftarrow)$: [[TODO]] I want to use [[Every Net on a Total Ordering has a Monotone Subnet]], but I'm not sure if it is true until I complete it.
