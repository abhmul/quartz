title: "Convex Hull"

# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ and $S \subset V$. Then the [[Convex Hull]] of $S$, denoted $\mathbf{conv} S$, is defined as $$\mathbf{conv} S := \bigcap\limits \{T \subset V : S \subset T, T \text{ is convex}\}.$$ 
## Remarks
1. $\mathbf{conv} S$ is the smallest [[Convex Set]] containing $S$ (since [[Intersection of Convex Sets is Convex]]).
2. [[The Set of all Convex Combinations is the Convex Hull]].
3. If $S$ is a [[Convex Set]], then $\mathbf{conv}S = S$. This can alternatively be taken as a definition for $S$.
