# Statement 1
Suppose $(\Omega, \mathcal{B}, \mathbb{P})$ is a [[Probability Space]] and $A, B \in \mathcal{B}$ so that $\mathbb{P}(B), \mathbb{P}(A) > 0$. Then

$$\mathbb{P}(B | A) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A | B) \mathbb{P}(B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)}$$

Note that all values are [[Well-Defined]] by are assumption that $A,B$ are not [[Null Set]]s.

## Proof
This follows from Definition 2 of [[Conditional Probability]]:

$$\mathbb{P}(B | A) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A | B) \mathbb{P}(B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)}$$

$\blacksquare$
