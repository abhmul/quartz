title: "Every Net on a Total Ordering has a Monotone Subnet"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] and let $(x_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in I} \subset X$ be a [[Net]] on $X$, with [[Index Set]] $I$. Then there exists a [[Subnet]] $(y_{\beta})_{\beta \in J} \subset X$ that is a [[Monotone Net]].

## Proof
Consider $\{x_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}$. If it has no [[Upper Bound]], ... [[TODO]] I think this needs [[Transfinite Induction]]
