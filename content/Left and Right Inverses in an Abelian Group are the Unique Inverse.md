title: "Left and Right Inverses in an Abelian Group are the Unique Inverse"
---

# Statement
Suppose $G$ is an [[Abelian Group]] and $u, v \in G$. Further suppose $v$ is a [[Left Inverse]]/[[Right Inverse]] of $u$. Then $v$ is the unique inverse of $u$.

## Proof
Because $G$ is an [[Abelian Group]], we have by [[Commutativity]] that $vu = uv$. One of these will be $e$ by assumption, thus the other must be as well. Therefore $v$ is an inverse of $u$. Because [[The inverse in a Group is unique]], we have uniqueness. $\blacksquare$
