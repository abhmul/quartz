title: "Disjoint Compact Sets are Separable from each other in a Hausdorff Space"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Hausdorff]] [[Topological Space]]. Then if $K, L \subset X$ are [[Compact]] and $K \cap L = \emptyset$, then there exists $U, V \subset X$ [[Open]] so that
1. $K \subset U$
2. $L \subset V$ 
3. $U \cap V = \emptyset$

## Proof
[[TODO]]
Sketch: This uses [[Compact Sets are Separable from Points in a Hausdorff Space]] to create an [[Open Cover]] for $L$. We can basically run the exact same logic from that proof. $\square$
