title: "Superset of Linearly Dependent Set is Linearly Dependent"

---
# Statement
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] and let $S \subset V$ be [[Linearly Dependent]]. Then for all $R \supset S$, $R$ is [[Linearly Dependent]].

## Proof
Use the same [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Linear Combination]] that makes $S$ [[Linearly Dependent]] for $R$. $\square$
