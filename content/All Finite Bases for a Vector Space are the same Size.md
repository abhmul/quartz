title: "All Finite Bases for a Vector Space are the same Size"

---
# Statement
Let $V$ be a [[Finite-Dimensional Vector Space]] and let distinct $\mathbf{a}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{a}_{n} \in V$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a [[Vector Space Basis]] for $V$. Then, if $S \subset V$ is a [[Vector Space Basis]] for $V$, $|S| = n$.

## Proof
Since $\mathbf{a}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{a}_{n}$ is a [[Vector Space Basis]] for $V$, their [[Subspace Span]] is $V$. Since $S$ is another [[Vector Space Basis]] for $V$, $S$ is [[Linearly Independent]]. Because [[Spanning Set Size bound Linearly Independent Set Size]], $|S| \leq n$. But by the same argument $|S| \geq n$. Therefore $|S| = n$. $\blacksquare$
