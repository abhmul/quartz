title: "Span is Monotonic"

# Statement
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] and let $S \subset R \subset V$. Then $\text{span}S \subset \text{span}R$.

## Proof
Observe
$$\text{span} R = \bigcap\limits\{W \subset V : R \subset W, W \text{ is a subspace of V}\} \supset R \supset S,$$
so by [[The Span of subset of a Span is also a subset of that Span]], we have that $\text{span} S \subset \text{span} R$. $\blacksquare$
