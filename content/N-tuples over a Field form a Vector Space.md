title: "N-tuples over a Field form a Vector Space"
---

# Statement
Let $F$ be a [[Field]]. Then $S = F^{n}$ is a [[Vector Space]].

## Proof
This follows by recalling that [[Cartesian Product]]s are defined as [[Function]]s, then applying [[Functions to a Field form a Vector Space]]. $\blacksquare$
