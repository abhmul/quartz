title: "Dimension of a Vector Space"

---
# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Finite-Dimensional Vector Space]] and let $S$ be a [[Vector Space Basis]] for $V$. Then $\dim V = |S|$. If $V$ is an [[Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space]], we denote $\dim V = \infty$.

## Remarks
1. This is [[Well-Defined]] for all [[Vector Space]]s because
	1. If there is a [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Vector Space Basis]], then [[All Finite Bases for a Vector Space are the same Size]].
	2. If there isn't, then the [[Dimension of a Vector Space|dimension]] is $\infty$.
2. We don't go into [[Set Cardinality]] here, for that see [[Cardinal Dimension of a Vector Space]].
