title: "Subset of a Precompact Set is Precompact"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]] and let $S \subset X$ be [[Precompact]]. Then if $R \subset S$, $R$ is [[Precompact]] as well.

## Proof
Because $\text{cl}S \supset R$, so $\text{cl}S \supset \text{cl}R$ by definition of [[Closure]]. Since $\text{cl}S$ is [[Compact]] and [[Closed Subset of a Compact Set is Compact]], $\text{cl}R$ is [[Compact]]. Thus $R$ is [[Precompact]]. $\blacksquare$
