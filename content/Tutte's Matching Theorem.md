title: "Tutte's Matching Theorem"

# Statment
Let $G = (V, E)$  be an [[Undirected Graph]]. For any $B \subset V$, let $\text{oc}(G[B])$ be the number of [[Graph Connected Component]]s of $G[B]$ with [[Odd Integer|odd]] number of [[Graph Vertex|vertices]]. Then $G$ has a [[Perfect Matching]] if and only if $\forall A \subset V$,  $\text{oc}(G[V \setminus A]) \leq |A|$.

## Proof
[[TODO]] - See [[Cook - Combinatorial Optimization]] Ch 5, Section 5.1, pg 131 - 133
