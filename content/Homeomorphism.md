# Definition
Let $X, Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s and let $f: X \to Y$ be a [[Function]]. $f$ is called a [[Homeomorphism]] if 
1. $f$ is a [[Bijection]]
2. $f$ is a [[Continuous Function]]
3. $f^{-1}$ is a [[Continuous Function]].

If such an $f$ exists between two spaces, we say they are [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] and write $X \sim Y$.

## Notes
Spaces that are [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] share many properties such as
1. [[Compactness is a Topological Invariant]]
2. [[Connectedness is a Topological Invariant]]

It is not hard to see that $\sim$ is an [[Equivalence Relation]] between [[Topological Space]]s. **Proof** [[TODO]].
