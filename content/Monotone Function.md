title: "Monotone Function"
---
# Definition 1
An [[Order-Preserving Function]]

# Definition 2
A [[Function]] that is either [[Non-Decreasing Function]] or [[Non-Increasing Function]]

## Remark
This term is [[Overload]]ed. Definition 2 usually applies when we are dealing with [[Total Ordering]]s, usually $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$. To avoid confusion I'll opt for [[Order-Preserving Function]] instead of definition 1.
