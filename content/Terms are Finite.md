title: "Terms are Finite"

---
# Statement
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a [[Language]] and let $\mathcal{T}$ be the [[Set]] of $\mathcal{L}$-[[Term]]s. Each $t \in \mathcal{T}$ is a [[Finite Set|Finite]] [[String]].

## Proof 1
This is a slick proof courtesy of [[Nick Hanson]].

Consider the [[Set]] of [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Term]]s, $\mathcal{T}'$. This [[Set]] exists by [[Axiom Schema of Specification]]. Observe that $\mathcal{T}'$ is closed under the properties satisfied by the [[Term]] [[Set]] $\mathcal{T}$. Since $\mathcal{T}$ is the [[Set Intersection|smallest]] such set, $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{T}'$. Thus each $t \in \mathcal{T}$ is [[Finite Set|finite]].

## Remarks
