title: "Order Topology coincides with Metric Topology on the Real Numbers"

---
# Statement
Let $\mathbb{R}$ be viewed as a [[Metric Space]] equipped with the [[Euclidean Distance]] and as a [[Total Ordering]] with its usual [[Order Relation]]. Then the [[Metric Topology]] on $\mathbb{R}$ is the [[Order Topology]] on $\mathbb{R}$
## Proof
[[TODO]] - this is plain enough to see since we can make [[Open Ball]]s from [[Open Ray]]s and we can take the [[Set Union|union]] of [[Open Ball]]s to create [[Open Ray]]s.
