title: "Directed Graph"
---

# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Set]] and suppose $E \subset V \times V$. Then $(V, E)$ is a [[Directed Graph]] with [[Graph Vertex|vertices]] $v \in V$ and [[Graph Edge|edges]] $e \in E$.

## Remarks
1. Sometimes we say $G$ is an [[Directed Graph]] and refer to its [[Graph Vertex|vertices]] and [[Graph Edge|edges]] as $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ respectively.
