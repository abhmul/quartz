title: "Univariate Polynomials on Real Numbers are Infinite-Dimensional"

---
# Statement
Let $P[\mathbb{R}]$ be the [[Space of Polynomials over a Field form a Vector Subspace of Function Vector Space|space of polynomials]] over $\mathbb{R}$. $P[\mathbb{R}]$ is an [[Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space]].

## Proof
[[TODO]] - Use [[Univariate Monomials form Infinite Basis for Univariate Polynomials on Real Numbers]] and [[Spanning Set Size bound Linearly Independent Set Size]].
