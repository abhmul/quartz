title: "Maximum Matching"
---

# Definition
Let $G$ be an [[Undirected Graph]] and let $\mathcal{M} = \{M \subset E(G) : M \text{ is a Matching}\}$. Then a [[Maximum Matching]] is a [[Matching]] $M \in \mathcal{M}$  so that $|M| = \max \{|M| \leq |E(G)| : M \in \mathcal{M}\}$. 

## Remarks
1. Note this definition is [[Well-Defined]] even for [[Infinite Set]]s because [[Cardinals form a Well-Ordering]].
2. The [[Set Cardinality]] of a [[Maximum Matching]] on $G$ is denoted $\nu(G)$.
