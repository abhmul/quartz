# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ and $S \subset V$. $S$ is an [[Affine Set]] if for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ and all $u, v \in S$
$$\lambda u + (1 - \lambda) v \in S$$
## Remarks
1. $S$ is an [[Affine Set]] [[If and Only If]] $S$ contains all [[Line]]s between its points. This is just a restatement of the definition of a [[Affine Set]].
