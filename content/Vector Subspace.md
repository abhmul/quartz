title: "Vector Subspace"
---

# Definition
Suppose $V$ is a [[Vector Space]] over [[Field]] $F$. Supppose $W \subset V$ and $W$ is a [[Vector Space]] over $F$ when endowed with the same $+$ and $*$ operations as $V$. Then we say $W$ is a [[Vector Subspace]] of $V$.

## Properties
1. [[A Subset of a Vector Space is a Subspace iff it is closed under scaling and addition]]
2. [[Intersection of Vector Subspaces is a Vector Subspace]]
3. [[Finite Sum of Vector Subspaces is a Vector Subspace]]
4. 

## Examples
1. [[Space of Polynomials over a Field form a Vector Subspace of Function Vector Space]]
