title: "Subsequence"
---

# Definition
Let $f: \mathbb{N} \to X$ be a [[Sequence]] on $X$. Let $g: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be an [[Increasing]] [[Function]]. Then $g \circ f$ is a [[Subsequence]] of $f$.

Oftentimes if $(a_{n}) \subset X$ is the sequence and $(n_{k}) \subset \mathbb{N}$ is the increasing function (i.e. $g$), then $(a_{n_{k}})$ is our subsequence.
