## Remarks
1. Often, in constructions, we talk about the "smallest" such [[Set]] which satisfies some properties. It is possible such a [[Set]] may not exist. However, if we can exhibit one [[Set]] with the desired properties that does exist, we can apply [[Set Intersection]] of its subsets that share those properties to arrive at the "smallest" such set.
