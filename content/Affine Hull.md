title: "Affine Hull"
---

# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ and $S \subset V$. Let $\mathcal{T} = \{T \subset V : S \subset T, T \text{ is affine}\}$. Then the [[Affine Hull]] of $S$, denoted $\mathbf{aff} S$, is defined as $$\mathbf{aff} S = \bigcap\limits_{T \in \mathcal{T}} T.$$ 
## Remarks
1. $\mathbf{aff} S$ is the smallest [[Affine Set]] containing $S$ (since [[Intersection of Affine Sets is Affine]]).
2. [[The Set of all Convex Combinations is the Convex Hull]]
