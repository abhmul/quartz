title: "Closed Subspaces of a Banach Space are Banach"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, ||\cdot||)$ be a [[Banach Space]]. Suppose $C \subset X$ is a [[Closed]] [[Vector Subspace]]. Then $(C, ||\cdot|| {\big|}_{C})$ is a [[Banach Space]]. 

## Proof
Simple application of
1. $C$ is a [[Normed Vector Subspace]]
2. [[Closed Subset of a Complete Space is Complete]]
