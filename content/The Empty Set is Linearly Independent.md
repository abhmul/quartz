title: "The Empty Set is Linearly Independent"

---
# Statement
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]]. Then $\emptyset \subset V$ is [[Linearly Independent]].

## Proof
Vacuously, there is no [[Finite Set|finite]] subset of $\emptyset$ so that there exists a nontrivial [[Linear Combination]] that equals $\mathbf{0}$. Thus $\emptyset$ is [[Linearly Independent]]. $\blacksquare$
