title: "Scalar product with -1 is additive inverse in vector spaces"
---

# Statement
Suppose $v \in V$. Then $-1 v = -v$.
## Proof
$$\begin{align*}
v + (-1) v &= 1 v + (-1) v\\
&=(1 - 1)v\\
&= 0 v\\
& \mathbf{0},
\end{align*}$$

where the last line follows from the property above. Because $V$ is an [[Abelian Group]], we know [[Left and Right Inverses in an Abelian Group are the Unique Inverse]], so $-1 v$ is the unique [[Additive Inverse]] of $v$. $\blacksquare$
