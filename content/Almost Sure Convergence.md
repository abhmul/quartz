title: "Almost Sure Convergence"
---

# Definition
Suppose $(\Omega, \mathcal{M}, \mathbb{P})$ is a [[Probability Space]] and $(Y, \tau)$ is a [[Topological Space]]. Suppose $(X_{n} : \Omega \to Y)$ is a [[Sequence]] of [[Random Element]]s and $X: \Omega \to Y$ is a [[Random Element]]. We say $X_{n} \to X$ [[Almost Sure Convergence|almost surely]] if $X_{n}$ [[Almost Everywhere Pointwise Convergence|converges almost everywhere]] to $X$.
