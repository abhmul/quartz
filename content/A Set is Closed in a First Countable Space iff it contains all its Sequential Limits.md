title: "A Set is Closed in a First Countable Space iff it contains all its Sequential Limits"
---

# Statement
Suppose $(X, \tau)$ is a [[First Countable Space]]. Then $K \subset X$ is [[Closed]] [[If and Only If]] $$K \supset \{x : \exists (x_n) \subset K \text{ s.t. } x_{n} \to x\}$$
That is, $K$ contains all its [[Sequence Convergence|sequential limits]].

## Proof
