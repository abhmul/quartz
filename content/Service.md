I enjoy finding ways to share what I like about math, computer science, and machine learning with others.

# Rice University
- (*Aug 2018 – May 2019*) **CS I/O Committee Director** I was the first director of an undergraduate committee that voices student opinion to the Rice CS Dept. We organized annual AMA for students to ask questions to the CS Dept chair and conducted monthly surveys of CS student population.

- (*Apr 2018 - Apr 2019*) **Rice Datathon Co-Director** I helped organize Rice’s first annual [datathon](https://datathon.rice.edu/), an 18-hour data science coding competition. We hosted over 150 students from Rice and awarded $3,000 in prizes.

- (*Jan 2017 - May 2017*) **Kaggle Club Co-Founder** I started a club for students to compete in data science competitions on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). The club became Rice’s first [Data Science Club](https://datasci.rice.edu/); today it has over 150 members.

- (*Nov 2016 – Sep 2017*) **HackRice 7 Co-Director** I handled planning, team management, and fundraising for [HackRice](https://hack.rice.edu/) 7. We raised $54,000 in sponsorship, hosted over 350 attendees, and offered $11,380 worth of prizes. We also worked with Second Servings Houston to donate leftover food and curb food waste.
