title: "Vector Subspace is a Normed Vector Subspace"

---
# Statement
Let $(V, ||\cdot||)$ be a [[Normed Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. If $W \subset V$ is a [[Vector Subspace]], then $(W, ||\cdot|| {\big|}_{W})$ is a [[Normed Vector Space]] called a [[Normed Vector Subspace]].

## Proof
$W$ is a [[Vector Space]] by defnition of [[Vector Subspace]]. The [[Norm]] [[Axiom]]s easily follow because they already hold $V$ and $W \subset V$. $\blacksquare$
