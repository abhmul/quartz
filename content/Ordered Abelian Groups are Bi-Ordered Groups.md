title: "Ordered Abelian Groups are Bi-Ordered Groups"

---
# Statement
Let $(G, \leq)$ be an [[Ordered Abelian Group]]. Then $G$ is a [[Bi-Ordered Group]].

## Proof
Let $g, h, h' \in G$ so that $h \leq h'$. Then because $G$ is a [[Left Ordered Group]],
$$hg = gh \leq gh' = h'g$$
so $G$ is also a [[Right Ordered Group]]. Thus $G$ is a [[Bi-Ordered Group]]. $\blacksquare$
