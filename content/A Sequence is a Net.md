title: "A Sequence is a Net"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Set]] and let $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subset X$ be a [[Sequence]]. Then $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a [[Net]].

## Proof
This follows by simply noting that $\mathbb{N}$ is [[Archimedean]] with its natural [[Well-Ordering]].  Thus it is a [[Directed Partial Ordering]].
