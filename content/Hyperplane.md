# Definition
Let $V$ be an [[Inner Product Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$. A [[Hyperplane]] is a [[Set]] of the form
$$H = \{x : \langle x, a \rangle = b\}$$
for any $a \in V$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$.

## Remarks
1. [[TODO]] - talk about the geometric interpretation, see [[Boyd - Convex Optimization]] - sect 2.2.1 page 27
