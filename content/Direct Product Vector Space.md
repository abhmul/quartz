title: "Direct Product Vector Space"

# Statement
Let $V$, $W$ be [[Vector Space]]s over [[Field]] $F$. Then  $V \times W$ equipped with
1. [[Additive Identity]] $(0, 0)$.
2. $+$ defined as $(x_{1}, x_{2}) + (y_{1}, y_{2}) = (x_{1} + x_{2}, y_{1} + y_{2})$ for $(x_{1}, x_{2}), (y_{1}, y_{2}) \in V \times W$.
3. $*$ defined as $c (x_{1}, x_{2}) = (cx_{1}, cx_{2})$ for $c \in F$ and $(x_{1}, x_{2}) \in V \times W$.

forms a [[Vector Space]]. It is known as the [[Direct Product Vector Space]]

## Proof
[[TODO]] - just run through the [[Vector Space]] [[Axiom]]s.
