title: "Subspace Span"

---
# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] on [[Field]] $F$. Let $S \subset V$. The [[Subspace Span]] of $S$ is $$\text{span} S = \bigcap\limits\{W \subset V : S \subset W, W \text{ is a subspace of V}\}$$
$\blacksquare$

## Properties
1. The [[Subspace Span]] is a [[Vector Subspace]] since [[Intersection of Vector Subspaces is a Vector Subspace]].
2. [[The Subspace Span is the Set of all Linear Combinations]]
