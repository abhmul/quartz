title: "Quotient Normed Vector Space"

---
# Definition
Let $(X, ||\cdot||)$ be a [[Normed Vector Space]] and let $Y \subset X$ be a [[Closed]] [[Vector Subspace]]. Then we call the [[Quotient Vector Space]] $X / Y$ endowed with the [[Quotient Norm]] $||[\cdot]||$ [[Quotient Normed Vector Space]].

## Remarks
1. The requirement that $Y$ is [[Closed]] is very important. See [[Quotient Norm]]
