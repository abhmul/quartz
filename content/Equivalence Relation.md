title: "Equivalence Relation"
---

# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Set]] and let $R \subset X \times X$ be a [[Relation]] on $X$. Then $R$ is an [[Equivalence Relation]] if it is a [[Preorder Relation]] with the following additional property:
- **Symmetry**: If $x, y \in X$ and $xRy$, then $yRx$.

# Remarks
1. As with [[Preorder]]s, $\pi_{1}(R) = \pi_{2}(R) = X$.
2. We often denote $R$ by $\sim$ or $=$.
3. If $(x, y) \not\in R$, then we write $x \not\sim y$ or $x \neq y$.
