title: "Matrix"

# Definition
Let $S$ be a [[Set]] and let $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. We say $(A_{ij} \in S)_{i \in [n], j \in [m]}$ is a [[Matrix]].

## Remarks
1. We often represent a [[Matrix]] as a "$n$ by $m$" table. For example 
	$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3  \\ 4 & 5 & 6\end{pmatrix}$$
	is a $2 \times 3$ [[Matrix]] over $\mathbb{Z}$.
2. We refer to the [[Set]] of all $n \times m$ [[Matrix|matrices]] on $S$ as $S^{n \times m}$.
3. Oftentimes, $S$ is taken to be a [[Ring]] or [[Field]]. This allows us to define [[Matrix Multiplication]].
