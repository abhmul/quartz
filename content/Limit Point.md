title: "Limit Point"
---

# Definition
Suppose $(X, \tau)$ is a [[Topological Space]]. Let $S \subset X$. Then $x \in X$ is a [[Limit Point]] of $S$ if $\forall U \in \tau$ such that $x \in U$, we have that $U$ and $S$ are not [[Mutually Disjoint]]. That is, $U \cap S \neq \emptyset$.

We denote
$$\bar{S} := \{x \in X : x \text{ is a limit point of } S\}$$
## Remarks
1. This notation should not be confused with the notation for the [[Closed Ball]], $\overline{B_{r}(x)}$, which may contain points besides [[Limit Point]]s. See [[Closure of Open Ball is a subset of Closed Ball]]
