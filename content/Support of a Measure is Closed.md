title: "Support of a Measure is Closed"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, \mathcal{B}(X), \mu)$ be a [[Borel Measure Space]] with [[Borel Measure]] $\mu$. Then $\text{supp}(\mu)$ is [[Closed]].

## Proof
Recall that [[Complement of Support of Measure is Union of all Null Open Sets]] and is thus [[Open]] by definition of [[Topological Space]]. Then, by definition of [[Closed]], $\text{supp}(\mu)$ is [[Closed]]. $\blacksquare$
