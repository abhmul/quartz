title: "Homeomorphisms transfer Bases"

---
# Statement
Let $X, Y$ be [[Topological Space]]s and let $X$ have [[Topological Basis]] $\mathcal{B}$. Suppose there exists [[Homeomorphism]] $\varphi: X \to Y$. Then $\varphi(\mathcal{B}) := \{\varphi(B) \subset Y : B \in \mathcal{B}\}$ is a [[Topological Basis]] for $Y$.

## Proof
[[A Function is a Homeomorphism iff it is a Bijective Continuous Open Map]], and [[Continuous Open Maps transfer Bases]].
