title: "Unit Sphere"

---
# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Normed Vector Space]]. The [[Unit Sphere]] is the [[Sphere]] of radius $1$ about $0 \in X$. It is denoted $S(X)$.
## Remarks
1. [[Unit Sphere]] is [[Closed]] because [[Sphere is Closed]].
2. Let $r > 0$ and $x \in X$. Then $S_{r}(x) = rS(X) + x$. Proof is almost identical to Remark 2 in [[Open Unit Ball]].
