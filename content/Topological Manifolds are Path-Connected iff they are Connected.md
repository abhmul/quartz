title: "Topological Manifolds Connected iff Path-Connected"

---
# Statement
Let $M$ be a [[Topological Manifold]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$. $M$ is [[Connected]] [[If and Only If]] it is [[Path-Connected]].

## Proof
[[Topological Manifolds are Locally Path-Connected]] and [[Locally Path-Connected Spaces are Path-Connected iff they are Connected]]. $\blacksquare$
