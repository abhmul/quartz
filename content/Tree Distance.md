title: "Tree Distance"
---

# Definition
Suppose $T$ is a [[Tree]]. Then the [[Tree Distance]] between $u, v \in V$ is the [[Path Length]] of the (unique) [[Simple Path]] from $u$ to $v$. We denote it $d(u, v)$.

## Remarks
1. [[Tree Distance]] is [[Shortest Path Distance]] on a [[Tree]], since the [[Shortest Path]] between any two [[Graph Vertex|vertices]] is the unique [[Simple Path]] between them. Thus our above notation can be used without confusion between the two.
