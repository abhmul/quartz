title: "Arity"

# Definition
The [[Arity]] of a [[Function]] is the number of arguments it takes. The [[Arity]] of a [[Relation]] is the number of items it relates.

## Examples
1. Consider $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ defined as $f(x) = x + 1$. This [[Function]] has [[Arity]] 1. It is said to be [[Unary]].
2. Consider $f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as $f(x) = ||\mathbf{x}||_{2}$. This [[Function]] has [[Arity]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$. It is said to be $n$-[[Arity|ary]].
3. Consider the relation $<$ on $\mathbb{R}$. It is $2$-[[Arity|ary]] because it relates two elements of $\mathbb{R}$ (e.g. $2 < 3$).

## Remarks
[[Arity]] is a useful concept for when we talk about [[Language]]s, which only consist of [[Symbol]]s. It doesn't make as much sense if we are talking about actual mathematical objects because no this depends on interpretation of the input objects. For example, is $x \in \mathbb{R}$ a single input to a function, or is it an [[Infinite Set|infinite]] number of inputs to a function, when we represent as a [[Decimal]] number?
