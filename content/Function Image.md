title: "Function Image"

---
# Definition
Let $S,T$ be [[Set]]s and let $f: S \to T$ be a [[Function]]. Then, if $A \subset S$, we call
$$f(A) := \{f(a) \in T : a \in A\}$$
the [[Function Image]] of $A$.

If we refer to [[Function Image]] without specification of a subset of $S$, we are refering to $f(S)$.
