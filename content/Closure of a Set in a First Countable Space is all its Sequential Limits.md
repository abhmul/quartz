title: "Closure of a Set in a First Countable Space is all its Sequential Limits"
---

# Statement
Suppose $(X, \tau)$ is a [[First Countable Space]]. Suppose $S \subset X$ Then $$\text{cl} S = \{x :  \exists (x_n) \subset S \text{ s.t. } x_{n} \to x\}$$

## Proof
Denote $T = \{x :  \exists (x_n) \subset S \text{ s.t. } x_{n} \to x\}$. Since the [[Closure of a Set is all its Limit Points]] and [[A point in a First Countable Space is a Limit Point iff it is a Sequential Limit]], we see
$$\text{cl} S = \bar{S} = T$$
