# Definition
Suppose $X$ is a [[Nonempty]] [[Set]] and $+: X \times X \to X$ is an [[Operation]] on $X$. Then $X$ is a [[Group]] if it satisfies the following properties:
1. [[Additive Identity]]: There exists $0 \in X$ so that for all $x \in X$, $0 + x = x$.
2. [[Associativity]] of $+$: For all $x,y,z \in X$, $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$
3. [[Additive Inverse]]s: If $x \in X$, then there exists $-x \in X$ so that $x + (-x) = 0 = (-x) + x$

## Remarks
1. In other words, a [[Group]] is a [[Monoid]] with [[Additive Inverse]]s.
2. When the context is clear, we often write $a + b$ as $ab$. This helps clear up confusion with the usual understanding of $+$.
3. If a [[Group]] also satisfies [[Commutativity]] of $+$, then it is an [[Abelian Group]]. 
4. [[The inverse in a Group is unique]]
