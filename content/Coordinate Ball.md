title: "Coordinate Ball"

---
# Definition
Let $M$ be a [[Topological Manifold]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$. Let $(U, \varphi)$ be a [[Coordinate Chart]] for $M$ and let $\hat{B} \subset \varphi(U)$ be an [[Open Ball]] in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then $\varphi^{-1}(\hat{B})$ is a [[Coordinate Ball]] on $M$.

## Remarks
1. Becuase $\varphi$ is a [[Homeomorphism]] and [[A Function is a Homeomorphism iff it is a Bijective Continuous Open Map]], $\varphi(U)$ is [[Open]], so $\hat{B}$ exists (by definition of [[Metric Topology]]).
2. $\varphi^{-1}(\hat{B})$ is [[Open]] because $\varphi$ is a [[Continuous Function]] by definition of [[Homeomorphism]].
