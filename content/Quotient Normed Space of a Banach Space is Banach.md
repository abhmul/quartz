title: "Quotient Normed Space of a Banach Space is Banach"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, ||\cdot||)$ be a [[Banach Space]] and let $Y \subset X$ be a [[Closed]] [[Vector Subspace]]. Then the [[Quotient Normed Vector Space]] $(X / Y, ||[\cdot]||)$ is a [[Banach Space]].

## Proof
[[TODO]] use
- [ ] [[A Metric Space is Complete iff all Absolutely Convergent Series Converge]]
- [ ] Use [[Quotient Norm]] definition to get close and then use [[Quotient Map is a Contraction Operator]]
