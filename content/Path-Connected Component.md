title: "Path-Connected Component"

---
# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Then $P \subset X$ is a [[Path-Connected Component]] of $X$ if $P$ is a [[Maximal]] (wrt [[Subset Relation]]) [[Path-Connected|path-connected set]]. That is, if $P' \subset X$ is [[Path-Connected]] and $P \subset P'$, then $P = P'$.
