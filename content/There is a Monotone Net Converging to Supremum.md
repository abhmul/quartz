title: "In a Dense Order there is a Net Converging to Supremum"

---
# Definition
Let $(X, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] with the [[Order Topology]]. Suppose $R \subset X$ and $\sup\limits R \in X$ exists. Then there exists a [[Monotone Function|monotone]] [[Net]] $(x_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A} \subset R$ such that $x_{\alpha} \to \sup\limits R$.

## Proof
Since $R$ is a [[Total Ordering]], it is also a [[Directed Partial Ordering]]. Thus, we can view $R$ as the [[Non-Decreasing Function|non-decreasing]] [[Net]] $(a_{a})_{a \in R}$. Since $\sup\limits R$ exists, we know $a_{a} \to \sup\limits R$ because [[Monotone Nets Converge to their Supremum]]. $\blacksquare$
