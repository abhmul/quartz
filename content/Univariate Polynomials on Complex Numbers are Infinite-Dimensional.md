title: "Univariate Polynomials on Complex Numbers are Infinite-Dimensional"

---
# Statement
Let $P[\mathbb{C}]$ be the [[Space of Polynomials over a Field form a Vector Subspace of Function Vector Space|space of polynomials]] over $\mathbb{C}$. $P[\mathbb{C}]$ is an [[Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space]].

## Proof
[[TODO]] - Use [[Univariate Polynomials on Real Numbers are Infinite-Dimensional]], $\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$, and [[Dimension of Subspace cannot be bigger than Parent Vector Space]].
