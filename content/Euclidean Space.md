# Definition (as a [[Vector Space]])
A [[Euclidean Space]] of [[Dimension of a Vector Space|dimension]] $n$ is the [[Vector Space]] on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$  over [[Field]] $\mathbb{R}$ where
1. for $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $x + y := (x_{1} + y_{1}, ..., x_{n} + y_{n})$
2. for $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $cx := (cx_{1}, ..., cx_{n})$

## The [[Euclidean Space]] is a [[Vector Space]]
**Proof**: [[TODO]]. This is not very difficult, just requires running through the definition of a [[Vector Space]].

# Definition (as a [[Inner Product Space]])
If we endow the [[Euclidean Space]] (as a [[Vector Space]]) with the [[Dot Product]], it becomes an [[Inner Product Space]]. This gives rise to a [[Normed Vector Space]] and [[Metric Space]] because [[Inner Products induce Norms]] and [[Norms induce Metrics]].

# Definition (as a [[Topological Space]])
Taking  the [[Euclidean Space]] as the [[Metric Space]] described above, we can endow it with the [[Metric Topology]]. Although it might seem that this [[Topological Space]] depends on the [[Inner Product]] used above, [[All Norms are Equivalent on Finite Dimensional Spaces]], so any [[Norm]] works.
