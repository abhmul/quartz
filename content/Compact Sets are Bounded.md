title: "Compact Sets are Bounded"

---
# Statement 1
Let $(Y, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] with the [[Order Topology]]. Let $K \subset Y$ be [[Compact]]. Then $K$ is a [[Bounded Set]].

## Proof
If $K = \emptyset$ then it is vacuously a [[Bounded Set]]. Otherwise, if $K$ is [[Nonempty]], then $K$ is a [[Bounded Set]] because [[Nonempty Compact Sets are Tightly Bounded]]. $\blacksquare$

# Statement 2
[[TODO]] - the corresponding statement for [[Metric Space]]s

# Other Outlinks
- [[Empty Set]]
