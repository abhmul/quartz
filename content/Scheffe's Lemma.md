# Statement
Let $F_{1}, F_{2}$ be two [[Probability Distribution Function]]s and suppose they have [[Probability Density Function|density]] [[function]]s $f_{1}, f_{2}$ with respect to [[Measure]] $\mu$ on $\mathcal{B}( \mathbb{R})$. Then  

$$\sup_{B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})} |F_{1}(B) - F_{2}(B)| = \frac{1}{2} \int |f_{1} - f_{2}| d \mu$$
In particular, if $F_{n}$ is a sequence of [[Probability Distribution Function]]s, $f_{n}$ the corresponding [[Probability Density Function]]s, and we have target $F$ with density $f$, then if $f_{n} \to f$ $\mu$-a.e. we have that $F_{n} \to F$ in [[Total Variation]].
