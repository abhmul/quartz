title: "Continuous Bijections from Compact Space to a Hausdorff Space are Homeomorphisms"

---
# Statement
Suppose $X$ is a [[Compact]] space, $Y$ is a [[Hausdorff]] space, and $f: X \to Y$ is a [[Continuous Function|continuous]] [[Bijection]]. Then $f$ is a [[Homeomorphism]].

## Proof
[[Continuous Functions from a Compact Space to a Hausdorff Space are Closed Maps]] and [[A Function is a Homeomorphism iff it is a Bijective Continuous Closed Map]]. $\square$

## Remarks
1. This is a very applicable result. For example, this shows us that any [[Injection|injective]] [[Continuous Function]] from $\mathbb{S}^{1} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ must be a [[Topological Embedding]].
2. According to [[Nick Hanson]], this is called the *Homeomorphism Sledgehammer*.
