title: "Equivalence Class"

# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Set]] and let $\sim$ be an [[Equivalence Relation]] on $X$. If $\mathcal{S}$ is the [[Partition]] of $X$ corresponding to $\sim$ (as per [[Correspondence of Surjective Functions, Partitions, and Equivalence Relations]]), then we call the elements $\mathcal{S}$ the [[Equivalence Class]]es of $\sim$.
