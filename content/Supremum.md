# Definition
Let $(T \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]]. Let $A \subset T$. Set $U = \{x \in T : x \geq a \text{ } \forall a \in A\}$. That is, $U$ is the [[Set]] of [[Upper Bound]]s of $A$. Then $\sup A$ (if it exists) is the [[Minimum]] of $U$.

## Remarks
1. If $A \subset T$ is s.t. $A = \emptyset$, then examining the definition of $U$, we see that the condition holds vacuously and $U = T$. Thus $\sup \emptyset = \min T$ if the minmum exists.
3. Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$. For some $u \in \mathbb{R}$, write $u \geq A$ if $\forall a \in A$, $u \geq a$. One of the equivalent conditions for [[Completeness of the Real Numbers]] is that every $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $\exists u \in \mathbb{R}$ with $u \geq A$ has a [[Supremum]] in $\mathbb{R}$.

## Basic Properties
- [[Sum of Supremum bounds Supremum of Sum]]
- [[There is a Monotone Net Converging to Supremum]]
- [[Non-Decreasing Continuous Functions preserve Supremum]]
- [[Non-Increasing Continuous Functions send Supremum to Infimum]]
- [[Negative Multiplication sends Supremum to Infimum]]
- [[Non-negative Multiplication Commutes with Supremum]]
- [[Supremum of Negative is Negative of Infimum]]
