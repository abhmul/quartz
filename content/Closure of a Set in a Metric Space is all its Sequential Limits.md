title: "Closure of a Set in a Metric Space is all its Sequential Limits"

---
# Statement
Suppose $(X, d)$ is a [[Metric Space]]. Suppose $S \subset X$ Then $$\text{cl} S = \{x :  \exists (x_n) \subset S \text{ s.t. } x_{n} \to x\}$$
## Proof
[[Metric Spaces are First Countable and Hausdorff]] and [[Closure of a Set in a First Countable Space is all its Sequential Limits]]. $\blacksquare$
