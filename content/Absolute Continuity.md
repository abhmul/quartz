title: "Absolute Continuity"

---
# Definition
Let $(X, \mathcal{M})$ be a [[Measure Space]] and let $\mu, \nu$ be two [[Measure]]s on this space. We say that $\nu << \mu$ ($\nu$ is [[Absolute Continuity|absolute continuous]] wrt $\mu$) if $\forall A \in \mathcal{M}$ s.t. $\mu(A) = 0$, we have that $\nu(A) = 0$. [[TODO]] - update this for [[Signed Measure]]s and [[Complex Measure]]s

## Properties
Some equivalent conditions:
1. [[A sigma-finite measure is absolutely continuous wrt another sigma-finite measure iff their Radon-Nikodym Derivative exists]]
2. [[A finite measure is absolutely continuous wrt another iff small sets on the other measure are also small on it]]
