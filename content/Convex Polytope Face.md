# Definition 1
Let $V$ be an [[Inner Product Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ and let $P \subset V$ be a [[Convex Polytope]]. Then a [[Set]] $F \subset P$ is a [[Convex Polytope Face|face]] of $P$ if any of the following is true:
1. $F = P$
2. $F = \emptyset$
3. there exists a [[Supporting Hyperplane]] $H \subset V$ so that $F = P \cap H$.
