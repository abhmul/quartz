title: "Minimum Vertex Cover"
---

# Definition
Let $G$ be an [[Undirected Graph]] and let $\mathcal{C} = \{C \subset V(G) : C \text{ is a Vertex Cover}\}$. Then a [[Minimum Vertex Cover]] is a [[Vertex Cover]] $C \in \mathcal{C}$  so that $|C| = \min \{|C| \leq |V(G)| : C \in \mathcal{C}\}$. 

## Remarks
1. Note this definition is [[Well-Defined]] even for [[Infinite Set]]s because [[Cardinals form a Well-Ordering]].
2. The [[Set Cardinality]] of a [[Minimum Vertex Cover]] on $G$ is denoted $\tau(G)$.
