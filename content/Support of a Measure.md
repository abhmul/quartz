title: "Support of a Measure"

---
# Definition 1
Let $(X, \mathcal{B}(X), \mu)$ be a [[Borel Measure Space]] with [[Borel Measure]] $\mu$. The [[Support of a Measure|support]] of $\mu$, denoted $\text{supp} (\mu)$, is defined
$$\text{supp}(\mu) = \{x \in X : \forall N_{x} \in \mathcal{N}_{x}, \mu(N_{x}) > 0\}$$
where $\mathcal{N}_{x}$ denotes the [[Set|collection]] of all [[Open]] sets containing $x$.

## Properties
1. [[Complement of Support of Measure is Union of all Null Open Sets]]. This gives an alternate definition.
2. [[Support of a Measure is Closed]]. This establishes that $\text{supp} (\mu) \in \mathcal{B}(X)$.
