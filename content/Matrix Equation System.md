title: "Matrix Equation System"

---
# Definition
Let $F$ be a [[Field]]. And consider a [[Finite Equation System]] of [[Order of an Equation System|order]] $m$
$$f_{i}(\mathbf{x}) = b_{i} \text{ }i \in [m]$$
for $\{f_{i} \in F^{F^{n}}\}_{i \in [m]}, \{b_{i} \in F\}_{i \in [m]}$. Then, it is a [[Matrix Equation System]] there exists some [[Matrix]] $A \in F^{m \times n}$ so that the [[Equation System]]
$$A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$$
for $\mathbf{b} = (b_{1}, \dots, b_{m}) \in F^{m}$ with the same [[Solution Set]].

## Remarks
1. We usually just represent a [[Matrix Equation System]] in terms of its [[Matrix]] and [[Equation System Constants]].
