title: "Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space"

---
# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]]. We say that $V$ is an [[Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space]] if it is not a [[Finite-Dimensional Vector Space]].

## Remarks
1. Note that this does not make any claim about whether $V$ has a [[Vector Space Basis]]. That is addressed in [[Every Vector Space has a Basis]], but we can still work with [[Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space]]s if we do not need a [[Vector Space Basis]].
