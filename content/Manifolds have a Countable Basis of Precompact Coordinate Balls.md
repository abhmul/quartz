title: "Manifolds have a Countable Basis of Precompact Coordinate Balls"

---
# Statement
Let $M$ be a [[Topological Manifold]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$. Then there exists a [[Topological Basis]], $\mathcal{B}$, for $M$ s.t.
1. $\mathcal{B}$ is [[Countable]]
2. Each $B \in \mathcal{B}$ is a [[Coordinate Ball]]
3. Each $B \in \mathcal{B}$ is [[Precompact]]

## Proof

- [x] [[Precompact]]
