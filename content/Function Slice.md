title: "Function Slice"

---
# Definition
Let $X,Y,Z$ be [[Topological Space]]s and suppose $F: X \times Y \to Z$ is a [[Function]]. Then the [[Function Slice]] of $F$ at $x \in X$ is the [[Function]] $y \mapsto F(x, y)$, denoted $F(x, \bullet)$ or $F_{x}$.

## Properties
1. [[Slices of a Continuous Function are Continuous]]
