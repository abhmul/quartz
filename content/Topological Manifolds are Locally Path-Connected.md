title: "Topological Manifolds are Locally Path-Connected"

---
# Statement
Let $M$ be a [[Topological Manifold]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$. $M$ is [[Locally Path-Connected]].

## Proof
 Consider a [[Coordinate Ball]]  $B \subset M$. Because 
 - [[The Restriction of Homeomorphism is a Homeomorphism in the Subspace Topology]]
 - [[Path-Connectedness is a Topological Invariant]]
 
 $B$ is [[Path-Connected]]. Because [[Coordinate Balls form a Basis for Manifolds]], we have that $M$ is [[Locally Path-Connected]]. $\blacksquare$
