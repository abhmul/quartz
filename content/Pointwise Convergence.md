title: "Pointwise Convergence"
---

# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Set]] and let $(Y, \tau)$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Suppose $(f_{n})$ is a [[Sequence]] of [[Function]]s from $X$ to $Y$. Suppose $f: X \to Y$ so that $\lim\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f_{n}(x) = f(x)$ $\forall x \in X$. Then we say that $(f_{n})$ [[Pointwise Convergence|converges pointwise]] to $f$.

## Remarks
1. We can also talk about [[Pointwise Convergence]] on subset $S \subset X$. This is just [[Pointwise Convergence]] of the [[Function Restriction]] on $S$.
