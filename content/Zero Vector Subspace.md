title: "Zero Vector Subspace"

---
# Statement
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] over [[Field]] $F$. Then the [[Set]] $\{\mathbf{0}\}$ is a [[Vector Subspace]] of $V$. It is known as the [[Zero Vector Subspace]] of $V$.

## Proof
Let $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in \{\mathbf{0}\}$. This means $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0}$. Let $c \in F$. Then $c \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = c \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{0}= \mathbf{0} \in \{\mathbf{0}\}$, so $\{\mathbf{0}\}$ is a [[Vector Subspace]] of $V$ since [[A Subset of a Vector Space is a Subspace iff it is closed under scaling and addition]]. $\blacksquare$
