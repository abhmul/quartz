title: "Indiscrete Topology"

# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Set]]. Then $\{\emptyset, X\}$ is a [[Topological Space|topology]] on $X$. It is called the [[Indiscrete Topology]] on $X$.

## Proof
1. $\emptyset, X \in \{\emptyset, X\}$ by construction $\checkmark$.
2. [[Finite Set|Finite]] [[Set Intersection]]s either include $\emptyset$ or they don't. If they do, then the [[Set Intersection]] is $\emptyset$, otherwise it is $X$ $\checkmark$.
3. [[Set Union]]s either include $X$ or they don't. If they do, then the [[Set Union]] is $X$. Otherwise it is $\emptyset$ $\checkmark$.
$\blacksquare$

## Properties
1. The [[Indiscrete Topology]] is the *coarsest* [[Topological Space]]. Every [[Topological Space]] on a [[Set]] contains the [[Indiscrete Topology]].
2. The [[Indiscrete Topology]] is **not** [[Hausdorff]]. It can serve as a useful counterexample when trying to test if a statement holds outside of [[Hausdorff]] spaces.
