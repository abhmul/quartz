title: "Halfspaces are Convex Sets"
---

# Statement 1
Let $V$ be an [[Inner Product Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$, let $a \in V$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $H$ be the [[Closed Halfspace]] $$H = \{x : \langle x, a \rangle \geq b\}.$$ Then $H$ is a [[Convex Set]].

## Proof
[[TODO]] This should follow from the fact that [[Inner Products are Linear in their first argument]]

# Statement 2
Let $V$ be an [[Inner Product Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$, let $a \in V$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$, and let $H$ be the [[Open Halfspace]] $$H = \{x : \langle x, a \rangle > b\}.$$ Then $H$ is a [[Convex Set]].

## Proof
[[TODO]] follows from statement 1 and [[Interior of Convex Set is Convex]].
