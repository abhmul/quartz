title: "The inverse in a Group is unique"
---

# Statement
Suppose $G$ is a [[Group]] and $u, v, w \in G$ so that $v$, $w$ are both [[Additive Inverse]]s of $u$. Then $v = w$.

## Proof
Denote $e \in G$ the [[Additive Identity]]. Then $$w = we = w(uv) = (wu)v = ev = v$$ by [[Associativity]]. $\blacksquare$
