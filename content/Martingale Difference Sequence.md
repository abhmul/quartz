title: "Martingale Difference Sequence"

---
# Definition
Let $(d_{j})$ be a [[Discrete-Time Process]] [[Adapted Process|adapted]] to [[Filtration]] $(\mathcal{B}_{j})$ with [[State Space]] $\mathbb{R}$. Then, it is a [[Martingale Difference Sequence]] if
1. $d_{j} \in L^{1}$ $\forall j \in \mathbb{N}$
2. $\mathbb{E}(d_{j+1} | \mathcal{B}_{j}) = 0$ $\forall j \in \mathbb{N}$

## Properties
1. [[A Discrete-Time Process is a Difference Sequence iff it is the difference of Martingale increments]]
2. (1) in other words: [[Accumulation of Martingale Difference Sequence is a Martingale]]
