# Definition
Let $(T, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] on $T$. Then $\leq$ is a [[Complete Ordering]] [[Order Relation|relation]] if for every [[Nonempty]] [[Set]] $A \subset T$ s.t. there exists $x \in T$ for which $A \leq x$ ($y \leq x$ $\forall y \in A$), then $\sup A$ exists in $T$.

Also known as the [[Least Upper Bound Property]].
