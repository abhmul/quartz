title: "Epsilon Principle"

# Statement
Let $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. Suppose for all $\epsilon > 0$, we have that $a \geq b - \epsilon$. Then $a \geq b$.

# Proof
Suppose not. Then $a < b$ and there exists some $\delta > 0$ s.t. $a = b - \delta$. But then $a < b - \frac{\delta}{2}$ which [[Proof by Contradiction|contradicts]] our assumption that $a \geq b - \epsilon$ for all $\epsilon > 0$. $\blacksquare$
