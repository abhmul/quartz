title: "Sequential Limits are Limit Points of the Sequence"
---

# Definition
Suppose $(X, \tau)$ is a [[Topological Space]] and let $(x_n) \subset X$. Suppose $x_{n} \to x \in X$. Then $x$ is a [[Limit Point]] of $\{x_{n} : n  \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

## Proof
Suppose $U \subset X$ is [[Open]]. Then, by definition of [[Sequence Convergence]], there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ so that $\forall n \geq N$, $x_{n} \in U$. Thus, $U \cap \{x_{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}\} \supset \{x_{n} : n \geq N\}$ and $x$ is a [[Limit Point]] of our [[Sequence]].
