title: "Every Matrix is Row Equivalent to a Row Reduced Echelon Matrix"

---
# Statement
Let $F$ be a [[Field]] and let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then for every $A \in F^{m \times n}$ there exists $R \in F^{m \times n}$ so that
1. $A \sim_{R} R$,
2. $R$ is a [[Row Reduced Echelon Matrix]].

## Proof
By applying [[Gaussian Elimination]], we can find a an $R \in F^{m \times n}$ such that the statement holds. $\blacksquare$
