title: "Undirected Graph"
---

# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Set]] and suppose $E \subset \{\{v, w\} \in \mathcal{P}(V) : v, w \in V, v \neq w\}$. Then $(V, E)$ is a [[Undirected Graph]] with [[Graph Vertex|vertices]] $v \in V$ and [[Graph Edge|edges]] $e \in E$.

## Properties
1. We can [[Represent an Undirected Graph as a Directed Graph]] by adding both directions for each edge.

## Remarks
1. Sometimes we say $G$ is an [[Undirected Graph]] and refer to its [[Graph Vertex|vertices]] and [[Graph Edge|edges]] as $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ respectively.
