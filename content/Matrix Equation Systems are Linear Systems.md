title: "Matrix Equation Systems are Linear Systems"

---
# Statement
Let $F$ be a [[Field]] and let 
$$A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$$
be a [[Matrix Equation System]] for $A \in F^{m \times n}, b \in F^{m}$ for $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then it is also a [[Linear Equation System]].

## Proof
[[TODO]] - this follows because [[Matrix Multiplication is a Linear Function]].
