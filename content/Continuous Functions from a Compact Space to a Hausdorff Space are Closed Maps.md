title: "Continuous Functions from a Compact Space to a Hausdorff Space are Closed Maps"

---
# Statement
Suppose $X$ is a [[Compact]] space, $Y$ is a [[Hausdorff]] space, and $f: X \to Y$ is [[Continuous Function|continuous]]. Then $f$ is a [[Closed Map]].

## Proof
Let $K \subset X$ be [[Closed]]. Since a [[Closed Subset of a Compact Set is Compact]], $K$ is [[Compact]]. [[Continuous Functions Preserve Compactness]], so $f(K)$ is [[Compact]] in $Y$. [[Compact Sets in Hausdorff Spaces are Closed]], so $f(K)$ is [[Closed]]. Since $K \subset X$ was an arbitrary [[Closed]] set, $f$ is a [[Closed Map]]. $\blacksquare$
