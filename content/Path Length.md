title: "Path Length"
---

# Definition
Suppose $G$ is a [[Directed Graph]] ([[Undirected Graph]]) and $P$ is a [[Graph Path]] on $G$. Then the [[Path Length]] of $P$ is the [[Tuple Order]] of $P$. We denote it $|P|$.

## Remarks
1. This is related, but should not be confused with [[Set Cardinality]].
