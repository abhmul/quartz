title: "Metric Space"

---
# Definition
A [[Metric Space]] is a [[Set]] $M$ equipped with a [[Distance Function]] $d: M \times M \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$.

## Remarks
1. A [[Metric Space]] is naturally endowed with the [[Metric Topology]]
2. An [[Extended Metric Space]] is a [[Metric Space]] if its [[Extended Distance Function]] is actually a [[Distance Function]]
