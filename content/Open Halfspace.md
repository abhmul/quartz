title: "Open Halfspace"
---

# Definition
Let $V$ be an [[Inner Product Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$. An [[Open Halfspace]] is a [[Set]] of the form
$$H = \{x : \langle x, a \rangle > b\}$$
for any $a \in V$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$.

## Remarks
1. An [[Open Halfspace]] is [[Open]]. [[TODO]] - prove this.
2. If $H$ is an [[Open Halfspace]], then $\text{cl} H$ is a [[Closed Halfspace]] - [[TODO]] prove this.
3. The [[Boundary]] of a [[Closed Halfspace]] is a [[Hyperplane]] - [[TODO]] prove this.
