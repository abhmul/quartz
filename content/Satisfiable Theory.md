title: "Satisfiable Theory"

---
# Definition
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a [[Language]] and let $T$ be an $\mathcal{L}$-[[Theory]]. We say $T$ is a [[Satisfiable Theory]] if there is an $\mathcal{L}$-[[Language Structure]] $\mathcal{M}$ such that $\mathcal{M} \models T$.

## Examples
1. Let $\mathcal{L} = \{0\}$. Here is an example of an $\mathcal{L}$-[[Theory]] that is **not** a [[Satisfiable Theory]]: $$T = \{x = 0, \neg(x = 0)\}.$$ The two [[Sentence]]s are [[Proof by Contradiction|contradictory]], so it has no [[Model]].
