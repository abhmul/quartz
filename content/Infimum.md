title: "Infimum"

---
# Definition 1
Let $(T \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]]. Let $A \subset T$. Let $T'$ be the [[Reverse Ordering]] of $T$ and let $A' = A$, but with the [[Reverse Ordering]]. Then $\inf\limits A := \sup\limits A'$.

## Remarks
1. In effect this is really saying that the [[Infimum]] is the greates [[Lower Bound]]. The use of the [[Reverse Ordering]] in the definition makes it easy to carry results about [[Supremum]] over to [[Infimum]].

## Basic Properties
1. [[Infimum of Sum bounds Sum of Infimum]]
2. [[Non-Decreasing Continuous Functions preserve Infimum]]
3. [[Non-Increasing Continuous Functions send Infimum to Supremum]]
4. [[Non-negative Multiplication Commutes with Infimum]]
5. [[Negative Multiplication sends Infimum to Supremum]]
6. [[Infimum of Negative is Negative of Supremum]]


# Definition 2
Let $(T \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]]. Let $A \subset T$. Set $L = \{x \in T : x \leq a \text{ } \forall a \in A\}$. That is, $L$ is the [[Set]] of [[Lower Bound]]s of $A$. Then $\inf A$ (if it exists) is the [[Maximum]] of $L$.

## Remarks
1. This is equivalent to definition 1, because [[Lower Bound]]s become [[Upper Bound]]s and [[Maximum|maxima]] become [[Minimum|minima]] in the [[Reverse Ordering]].
