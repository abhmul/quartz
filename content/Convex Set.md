title: "Convex Set"

# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ and $S \subset V$. $S$ is a [[Convex Set]] if for all $\lambda \in [0,1]$ and all $u, v \in S$
$$\lambda u + (1 - \lambda) v \in S$$
## Remarks
1. $S$ is a [[Convex Set]] [[If and Only If]] $S$ contains all [[Closed Line Segment]]s between its points. This is just a restatement of the definition of a [[Convex Set]].
2. [[A Set is Convex iff it contains all of its Convex Combinations]]
