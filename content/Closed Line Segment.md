title: "Closed Line Segment"
---

# Definition
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ and $x_{1}, x_{2} \in V$. The [[Closed Line Segment]] $L \subset V$ between $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ the [[Set]] $$L = \{\lambda x_{1} + (1 - \lambda) x_{2} : \lambda \in [0,1]\}$$
## Remarks
1. $L$ can also be expressed as $L = \{x_{2} + \lambda (x_{1} - x_{2}) : \lambda \in [0,1] \}$. This follows from the observation that $$\lambda x_{1} + (1 - \lambda) x_{2} = x_{2} + \lambda x_{1} - \lambda x_{2} = x_{2} + \lambda (x_{1} - x_{2})$$
