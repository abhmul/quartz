title: "Closed Interval"

---
# Definition
Let $(T, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]]. An [[Closed Interval]] is $[a,b]$ for $a \leq b \in T$ is the [[Set]]
$$[a,b] := \{x \in T : a \leq x \leq b\}$$
## Remarks
1. $[a, a] = \{a\}$ for $a \in T$.
2. Sometimes, when referring to an [[Closed Interval]], we may include [[Closed Ray]]s and $T$ itself.
