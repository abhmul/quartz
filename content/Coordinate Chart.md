# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]]. A [[Coordinate Chart]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$ on $X$ is a pair ($U$, $\varphi$) where
1. $U \subset X$ is an [[Open]] set
2. $\varphi : U \to \hat{U}$ is a [[Homeomorphism]] for some $\hat{U} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ [[Open]].

## Remarks
1. For a [[Coordinate Chart]] $(U, \varphi)$, we will often use the phrase that this [[Coordinate Chart]] "contains" $p \in M$. This just means $p \in U$.
2. For some [[Open]] $\hat{V} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, if we say that $(U, \varphi)$ is a [[Coordinate Chart]] to $\hat{V}$, we mean that $\varphi$ has [[Codomain]] $\hat{V}$.
