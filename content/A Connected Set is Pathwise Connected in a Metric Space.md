title: "A Connected Set is Pathwise Connected in a Metric Space"

---
[[TODO]] - Suppose not. $x, y$ not [[Path-Connected]]. Create [[Set]]s of all points pathwise connected to $x$ and those pathwise connected to $y$. This is an [[Open]] since each point has an [[Open Ball]] around it that is contained in the set. This creates a disconnection of the set.
