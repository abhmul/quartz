title: "Bounded Function Space"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Set]] and let $(Y, ||\cdot||)$ be a [[Normed Vector Space]]. Then
$$B(X, Y) := \{f: X \to Y : \sup\limits_{x \in X} ||f(x)|| < \infty\}$$
is a [[Normed Vector Space]] with the [[Supremum Norm]] $||\cdot||_{\infty}$.

## Proof
This follows from noting that the [[Supremum Norm]] is an [[Extended Norm]], [[Functions to a Vector Space form a Vector Space]] and [[Restricting an Extended Norm to elements of Finite Norm form a Normed Vector Space]]. $\square$
