title: "Compact Sets in the Order Topology contain their Extrema"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] and let $K \subset X$ be [[Compact]]. Then $\sup\limits K$ and $\inf\limits K$ both exist. Furthermore, $\sup\limits K \in K$ and $\inf\limits K \in K$.

## Proof
Recall that [[A Nonempty Set is Compact in the Order Topology iff it is Tightly Bounded and Complete]]. Therefore, $K$ has an [[Upper Bound]] and a [[Lower Bound]]. Because the [[Order Topology is Hausdorff]] and [[Compact Sets in Hausdorff Spaces are Closed]], we know $K$ is [[Closed]].
