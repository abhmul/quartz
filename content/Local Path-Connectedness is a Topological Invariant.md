title: "Local Path-Connectedness is a Topological Invariant"

---
# Statement
Suppose $X, Y$ are [[Topological Space]]s and $X \cong Y$. Then $X$ is [[Locally Path-Connected]] [[If and Only If]] $Y$ is.

## Proof
Because the [[Function Inverse]] of a [[Homeomorphism]] is a [[Homeomorphism]], we only need to prove the $(\Rightarrow)$ direction. Suppose $X$ is [[Locally Path-Connected]]. But this follows easily because [[A Function is a Homeomorphism iff it is a Bijective Continuous Open Map]], [[Continuous Open Maps transfer Bases]], and [[Continuous Functions Preserve Path-Connectedness]]. $\blacksquare$
