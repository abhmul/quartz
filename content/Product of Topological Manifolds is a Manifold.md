title: "Product of Topological Manifolds is a Manifold"

---
# Statement
Let $M_{1}, \dots, M_{k}$ be [[Topological Manifold]]s of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n_{1}, \dots, n_{k}$. Then the [[Product Topological Space]] $M_{1} \times \cdots \times M_{k}$ is a [[Topological Manifold]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n_{1} + \cdots + n_{k}$.

## Proof
We need to show that $M := M_{1} \times  \cdots \times M_{k}$ is
1. [[Hausdorff]]
2. [[Second Countable]]
3. [[Locally Euclidean]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n:= n_{1} + \cdots + n_{k}$

To that end
1. [[Every Finite Product of Hausdorff Spaces is Hausdorff]]
2. [[Every Finite Product of Second Countable Spaces is Second Countable]]
3. Let $p := (p_{1}, \dots, p_{k}) \in M$ and let $p_{1} \in (U_{1}, \varphi_{1}), \dots, p_{k} \in (U_{k}, \varphi_{k})$ be [[Coordinate Chart]]s for $M_{1}, \dots, M_{k}$ respectively. We claim $(U_{1} \times \cdots \times U_{k}, \varphi_{1} \times \cdots \times \varphi_{k}) =: (U, \varphi)$ is a [[Coordinate Chart]] of $M$ that contains $p$. By construction, $p \in U$. Furthermore, the [[Product Topological Space]] is generated by [[Finite Set|finite]] [[Cartesian Product]]s of [[Open]] sets of the constituent spaces, so $U$ is [[Open]]. Because [[A Product of Homeomorphisms is a Homeomorphism]], $\varphi$ is a [[Homeomorphism]] to $\hat{U_{1}} \times \cdots \times \hat{U_{k}} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{R}^{n_{k}} \cong \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Since $p \in M$ was arbitrary, $M$ is [[Locally Euclidean]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$.
