title: "A Distribution Function is Determined on a Dense Set"
---

# Statement
Let $D \subset \mathbb{R}$ be [[Dense]] and let $F_{D}: D \to \mathbb{R}$. Then if we define

$$F(x) = \inf_{y \in D; y > x} F_{D}(y)$$
$F$ is a [[Distribution Function]]. 

Furthermore, if $G$ is a [[Distribution Function]] so that $G {\big|}_{D} = F_D$, then $G = F$.

# Proof
Observe that since $D$ is [[Dense]] and $\mathbb{R}$ is [[Archimedean]], $\{F_{D}(y): y \in D, y > x\}$ is nonempty $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$. So we must simply show that $F$ satisfies the definition of a [[Distribution Function]]. That is, we must show that $F$ is [[Non-Decreasing Function]] and [[Right-Continuous]].

To see $F$ is non-decreasing, let $x,z \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $x \leq z$. Then we see

$$\begin{align*}
F(x) &= \inf \{F_{D}(y) : y \in D, y > x \}\\
&\leq \inf\{F_{D}(y) : y \in D, y > z \geq x\}\\
&= F(z)
\end{align*}$$

To see $F$ is right-continuous, let $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $\epsilon > 0$. We will find $\delta > 0$ s.t. $F(z) - F(x) < \epsilon$ $\forall z \in (x, x+\delta)$. Since [[Finite Extremums get arbitrarily close]], we have that there exists $x < y \in D$ s.t. $F_{D}(y)- F(x) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$.  Set $\delta = y - x$. Then for any $z \in (x, x + \delta)$ we have that $z < y$ so $F_{D}(y) \geq F(z)$. But also $z > x$ so $F(z) \geq F(x)$ since $F$ is non-decreasing. Thus 

$$F(z) - F(x) \leq F_{D}(y) - F(x) < \frac{\epsilon}{2} < \epsilon$$
showing that $F$ is right-continuous and that it is a distribution function.

Now let $G$ be a [[Distribution Function]] so that $G {\big|}_{D} = F_D$. This means $F_{D}$ is [[Non-Decreasing Function]] and $G$ is [[Right-Continuous]]. Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Since $D$ is [[Dense]], we can construct a decreasing [[Sequence]] $\{y_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subset D$ s.t. $y_{n} \in (x + \frac{1}{n+1}, x + \frac{1}{n})$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then 
$$\{y \in D : y > x\} \supset \{y_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$$
so 

$$\begin{align*}
F(x) &= \inf \{F_{D}(y) : y \in D, y > x \} \\
&\leq \inf_{y_{n}} F_{D}(y_{n})\\
&= \lim\limits_{y_{n} \to x} G(y_{n})\\
&= G(x)
\end{align*}$$
On the other hand, for every $y \in D$ s.t. $y > x$, $\exists n \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. 
$$y_{n} < x + \frac{1}{n} < y$$
Thus, by monotonicity of $F_D$,
$$F_{D}(y) \geq \lim\limits_{y_{n} \to x} F_{D}(y_{n})= G(x)$$
so
$$F(x) = \inf \{F_{D}(y) : y \in D, y > x \} \geq G(x)$$

giving us $G(x) = F(x)$. $\blacksquare$


# Remarks
1. The first half of the proof does not actually require $D$ to be [[Dense]] or for $F_{D}$ to be [[Non-Decreasing Function]]. $D$ need only be [[Archimedean]]. This proof gives us a technique for constructing [[Distribution Function]]s from any function on an [[Archimedean]] subset of $\mathbb{R}$.
2. If $F$ and $G$ are any two [[Distribution Function]]s that agree on a [[Dense]] subset of $\mathbb{R}$, we must have that $F = G$, namely because they are both equal to the distribution function generated by their restrictions to the dense set.
