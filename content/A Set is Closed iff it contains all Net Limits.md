title: "A Set is Closed iff it contains all Net Limits"

---
# Statement
Suppose $(X, \tau)$ is a [[Topological Space]]. Then $K \subset X$ is [[Closed]] [[If and Only If]] for all [[Net]]s $\{x_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A} \subset K$ s.t. $x_{\alpha}\to x \in X$, we have that $x \in K$.

## Proof
This follows quickly from [[A set is Closed iff it contains all its Limit Points]] and [[A point is a Limit Point iff it is a Net Limit]]. $\blacksquare$
