# Definition
A [[Stock]] is a [[Security]] that represents fractional ownership of a [[Corporation]]. Units of [[Stock]] are called [[Share]]s.

## Ownership
A [[Share]] of a [[Stock]] represents fractional ownership of a [[Corporation]], determined by the number of [[Outstanding Share]]s. For example, if a [[Corporation]] has 5000 outstanding shares, and I hold 100 of those, then I own 2% of the [[Corporation]]. The percentage does not depend on the number of [[Reserve Share]]s.

Although a [[Stock]] *represents* fractional ownership of a [[Corporation]], it does not mean ownership of the [[Corporation]] itself. Legally, a [[Corporation]] is considered a person and thus files its own taxes, owns assets, and can be sued. To own a [[Corporation]] would be akin to slavery. Rather, [[Shareholder]]s are *entitled* to a portion of the [[Corporation]]s assets and (depending on the type of stock) may have voting rights at shareholder meetings. Shareholders also receive [[Dividend]]s (if they are distributed), and can sell their shares to someone else.

## Trading
[[Stock]]s are usually bought and sold at [[Stock Exchange]]s. [[TODO]]
