title: "Order-Preserving Function"

---
# Definition
Let $X, Y$ be [[Partial Ordering]]s. Let $f: X \to Y$ be a [[Function]]. We say $f$ is [[Order-Preserving Function|order-preserving]] if for $x, x' \in X$, $$x \leq x' \Rightarrow f(x) \leq f(x').$$
## Remarks
1. A [[Non-Decreasing Function]] is an [[Order-Preserving Function]]
2. An [[Order-Preserving Function]] may also be called a [[Monotone Function]]. I will avoid this though, because a [[Monotone Function]] may also refer to a [[Non-Increasing Function]], which is not an [[Order-Preserving Function]].
