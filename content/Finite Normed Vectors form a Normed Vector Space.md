title: "Finite Normed Vectors form a Normed Vector Space"

---
# Statement
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] and let $||\cdot||$ be an [[Extended Norm]] on $V$. Then $X \subset V$ defined as
$$X := \{x \in V : ||x|| < \infty\}$$
is a [[Normed Vector Space]].

## Proof
[[TODO]], this basically requires applying the [[Homogeniety]] and [[Triangle Inequality]] properties of an [[Extended Norm]] ([[Norm]])
