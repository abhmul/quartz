title: "Supremum is in the Closure of a Nonempty Set"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, \leq)$ be a [[Total Ordering]] endowed with the [[Order Topology]]. Suppose $A \subset X$ is [[Nonempty]] and $\sup\limits A \in X$. Then $\sup\limits A \in \text{cl} A$.

## Proof 1
[[There is a Monotone Net Converging to Supremum]] and [[Closure of a Set is all its Net Limits]]. $\square$

## Proof 2
Let $U \subset X$ be [[Open]] so that $\sup\limits A \in U$. By [[Topology Generated by a Basis|construction]] of the [[Order Topology]] we know there must be some [[Open Interval]] (including [[Open Ray]]s and $X$) contained in $U$ that contains $\sup\limits A$. Let $(a,b)$ be this [[Open Interval]] (where potentially $a = \leftarrow$ or $b = \rightarrow$). Suppose $(a,b) \cap A = \emptyset$. If $a = \leftarrow$, then since $A \subset (\leftarrow, \sup\limits A] \subset (\leftarrow, b)$, we must have that $A = \emptyset$ $\unicode{x21af}$. Otherwise, if $a \neq \leftarrow$ (i.e. $a \in X$), then 
$$A = A \cap (\leftarrow, \sup\limits A] = A \cap (\leftarrow, b) = (A \cap (\leftarrow, a]) \sqcup (A \cap (a,b)) = A \cap (\leftarrow, a]$$
so $a$ is an [[Upper Bound]] for $A$. But then $a < \sup\limits A$, so $\sup\limits A$ is not a [[Supremum]] $\unicode{x21af}$. Therefore $(a,b) \cap A \neq \emptyset$ and $\sup\limits A$ is a [[Limit Point]] of $A$. Then $\sup\limits A \in \text{cl}A$ since [[Closure of a Set is all its Limit Points]]. $\blacksquare$
