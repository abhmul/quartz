title: "Closed Halfspace"
---

# Definition
Let $V$ be an [[Inner Product Space]] over $\mathbb{R}$. A [[Closed Halfspace]] is a [[Set]] of the form
$$H = \{x : \langle x, a \rangle \geq b\}$$
for any $a \in V$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$.

## Remarks
1. A [[Closed Halfspace]] is [[Closed]]. [[TODO]] - prove this.
2. If $H$ is an [[Closed Halfspace]], then $\text{int} H$ is an [[Open Halfspace]] - [[TODO]] prove this.
3. The [[Boundary]] of a [[Closed Halfspace]] is a [[Hyperplane]] - [[TODO]] prove this.
