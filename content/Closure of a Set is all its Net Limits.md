title: "Closure of a Set is all its Net Limits"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]] and let $S \subset X$. Then
$$\text{cl}S = \{x \in X : x_{\alpha} \to x \text{ for some net } (x_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A} \subset X\}$$
## Proof
[[Closure of a Set is all its Limit Points]] and [[A point is a Limit Point iff it is a Net Limit]]. $\square$
