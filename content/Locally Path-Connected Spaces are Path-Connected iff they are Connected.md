title: "Locally Path-Connected Spaces are Path-Connected iff they are Connected"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Space]] that is [[Locally Path-Connected]]. Then $X$ is [[Path-Connected]] [[If and Only If]] $X$ is [[Connected]]

## Proof
$(\Rightarrow)$: This direction follows from the general case: [[Path-Connected implies Connected]].

$(\Leftarrow)$: If $X$ is [[Connected]], then it has a single [[Connected Component]] that is $X$ itself. Since [[Path-Connected Components are equal to the Connected Components in a Locally Path-Connected Space]], $X$ is a [[Path-Connected Component]]. But this just means $X$ is [[Path-Connected]]. $\blacksquare$
