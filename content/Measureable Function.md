title: "Measureable Function"
---

# Definition
Let $(X, \mathcal{M})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{N})$ be [[Measure Space]]s. Let $f: X \to Y$ be a [[Function]]. Then $f$ is a [[Measureable Function]] if
$$\sigma(f) \subset \mathcal{M}$$
## Remarks
1. We sometimes denote the [[Set]] of $(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$-[[Measureable Function]]s as $\mathcal{L}^{0}(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$. If we are considering [[Measureable Function]]s up to [[Almost Everywhere Equivalence Relation|null sets]], we will refer to the collection of [[Equivalence Class]]es as $L^{0}(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$. We may also use the following abbreviations:
	1.  $L^{0}(X, Y)$, when the associated [[Sigma Algebra]]s are understood to be $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$.
	2. $L^{0}(\_)$ where $\_$ is a single argument from the above two forms. A single argument is used when it is well understood what the other argument is and whether it is the source or target.
	3. $L^{0}$ when all arguments are well understood and not ambiguous
