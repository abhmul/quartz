title: "Graph of a Function"

---
# Definition
Let $X, Y$ be [[Set]]s and let $f: X \to  Y$.  Then the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] of $f$ is the [[Set]]
$$\Gamma(f) := \{(x, f(x)) \in X \times Y : x \in X\} = f$$
## Remarks
1. This is really just a way to write $f$ that highlights the [[Relation]]al aspect of $f$.
