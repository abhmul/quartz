title: "Unit Vector"

---
# Definition
Let $(X, ||\cdot||)$ be a [[Normed Vector Space]]. We say $x \in X$ is a [[Unit Vector]] if $||x|| = 1$.

## Remarks
1. The [[Unit Sphere]] is the [[Set]] of [[Unit Vector]]s.
2. For any $x \in X$ so that $x \neq 0$, we can rescale it to be a [[Unit Vector]] by taking $\hat{x} := \frac{x}{||x||}$.
