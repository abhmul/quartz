title: "Subset of Linearly Independent Set is Linearly Independent"

---
# Statement
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] and let $S \subset V$ be [[Linearly Independent]]. Then for all $R \subset S$, $R$ is [[Linearly Independent]].

## Proof
If not, then $S$ would be [[Linearly Dependent]] by [[Superset of Linearly Dependent Set is Linearly Dependent]]
