title: "Direct Product Normed Space"

---
# Statement
Let $(X, ||\cdot||_{X}), (Y, ||\cdot||_{Y})$ be [[Normed Vector Space]]s. Then the [[Direct Product Vector Space]] $X \times Y$ equipped with a [[p-norm]] $||\cdot||_{p} : X \times Y \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ defined as
$$||(x, y)||_{p} := (||x||^{p} + ||y||^{p})^{\frac{1}{p}}$$
forms a [[Normed Vector Space]]. It is known as the [[Direct Product Normed Space]].

## Remarks
1. Sometimes, this space is called the "$l_{p}$ sum of $X$ and $Y$" and written $X \oplus_{p} Y$.
