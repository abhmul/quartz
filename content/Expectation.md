title: "Expectation"

# Definition
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{B}, \mathbb{P})$ be a [[Probability Space]] and let $X$ be a [[Random Variable]] on $\Omega$. The [[Expectation]] of $X$ is defined as 

$$\mathbb{E}(X) := \int\limits_{\Omega} X d \mathbb{P}(\omega)$$

so long as the right hand quantity exists. If it does not, we say $\mathbb{E}(X)$ does not exist.
