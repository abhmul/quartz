# Definition
Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological Space]]. Then $D \subset X$ is **Dense** if the [[Closure]] of $D$ is $X$. 


## Properties
1. [[The following are Equivalent]]
	- $D$ is [[Dense]]
	- $X$ is the only [[Closed|closed set]] containing $D$
	- The [[Interior]] of the [[Complement]] of $D$ is [[Empty Set|empty]]
	- $\forall x \in X$, either $x \in D$ or $x$ is a [[Limit Point]] of $D$
	- $\forall x \in X$, every [[Neighborhood of a Point]] $U$ of $x$ is not [[Mutually Disjoint]] with $D$. That is $U \cap D \neq \emptyset$.
	- $D \cap U \neq \emptyset$ $\forall U \in \tau$
2. Suppose $\mathcal{B} \subset \tau$ is a [[Topological Basis]] for $(X, \tau)$. Then [[The following are Equivalent]]
	- $D$ is [[Dense]]
	- For every $x \in X$, every [[Basic Neighborhood]] $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing $x$ is not [[Mutually Disjoint]] with $D$. That is $B \cap D \neq \emptyset$.
	- $D \cap B \neq \emptyset$ $\forall B \in \mathcal{B}$
4. Suppose $X, \tau$ is the [[Metric Topology]] generated by [[Metric Space]] $(X, d)$. Then [[The following are Equivalent]]
	- $D$ is [[Dense]]
	- $\{x \in X : x = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} y_{n}, (y_{n}) \subset D\} = X$. This is just the [[Closure]] of $D$ in a [[Metric Space]].
	- $\forall \epsilon > 0$, $x \in X$, $B_{\epsilon}(x) \cap D \neq \emptyset$. That is, there exists $y \in X$ so that $d(y,x) < \epsilon$.
