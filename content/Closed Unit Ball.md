title: "Closed Unit Ball"

# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Normed Vector Space]]. The [[Closed Unit Ball]] is the [[Closed Ball]] of radius $1$ about $0 \in X$. It is denoted $\overline{B(X)}$.

## Remarks
1. [[Closed Unit Ball]] is [[Closed]] because [[Closed Ball is Closed]].
2. Let $r > 0$ and $x \in X$. Then $\overline{B_{r}(x)} = r \overline{B(X)} + x$. Proof is almost identical to Remark 2 in [[Open Unit Ball]].
