title: "Topological Invariance of Dimension"

---
# Statement
Let $M$ be a [[Nonempty]] [[Topological Manifold]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$ and let $N$ be a [[Topological Manifold]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $m$. If $M$ is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to $N$, then $m=n$.

## Proof
[[TODO]] - This will be done with [[De Rham Cohomology]]. See [[Lee - Introduction to Smooth Manifolds]] ch 17.
