# Definition
Suppose $M$ is a [[Topological Space]]. We say $M$ is a [[Topological Manifold]] with [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$ if
1. $M$ is a [[Hausdorff]]
2. $M$ is a [[Second Countable]]
3. $M$ is [[Locally Euclidean]] of [[Manifold Dimension]] $n$

## Examples
1. [[Graphs of Continuous Functions are Topological Manifolds]]
