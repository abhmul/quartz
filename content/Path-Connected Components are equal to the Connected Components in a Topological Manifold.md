title: "Path-Connected Components are equal to the Connected Components in a Topological Manifold"

---
# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[Topological Manifold]]. Then the [[Set|collection]] $\mathcal{P} := \{P \subset X : P \text{ is a path-component of }X\}$ is equal to $\mathcal{C} := \{C \subset X : C \text{ is a connected component of }X\}$.

## Proof
[[Topological Manifolds are Locally Path-Connected]] and [[Path-Connected Components are equal to the Connected Components in a Locally Path-Connected Space]]. $\blacksquare$
