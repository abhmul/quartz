# Definition 1
Suppose $X$ is a [[Topological Space]]. We say $X$ is [[Connected]] if the only pair of [[Set]]s $U, V$ satisfying
1. $U, V$ [[Open]]
2. $U \cap V = \emptyset$
3. $U \cup V = X$

are $\emptyset, X$.

# Definition 2
Suppose $X$ is a [[Topological Space]] and $S \subset X$. We say $S$ is [[Connected]] if it is a [[Connected|connected space]] when given the [[Subspace Topology]].
