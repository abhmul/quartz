title: "All points in a Set are Limit Points"

# Statement
Let $X, \tau$ be a [[Topological Space]] and let $S \subset X$. Then $$\bar{S} \supset S$$

## Proof
Suppose $x \in S$. Suppose $U \subset X$ be [[Open]] s.t. $x \in U$. Then $U \cap S \supset \{x\}$. Since $U$ was arbitrary, $x$ is a [[Limit Point]] of $S$. $\blacksquare$
