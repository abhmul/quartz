title: "Positive Semidefinite Matrix"
---

# Definition
Suppose $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $$x^{T} A x \geq 0$$. Then $A$ is a [[Positive Semidefinite Matrix]]. We denote the set of $n \times n$ [[Positive Semidefinite Matrix]]s $\mathbb{S}_{n}^{+}$

## Propertes
1. [[A Square Matrix is Positive Semidefinite iff its Eigenvalues are Nonnegative]]
2. [[A Square Matrix is Positive Semidefinite iff all of its Principal Minors are Nonnegative]]
3. [[A Square Matrix is Positive Semidefinite iff it is the Gram Matrix of n vectors]]
4. [[A Square Matrix is Positive Semidefinite iff it is the product of a Matrix with its Transpose]]
5. [[Positive Semidefinite Matrices form a Convex Cone]]
6. [[Positive Semidefnite Matrices are Symmetric]] - Thus justifies the notation.
7. [[A Symmetric Matrix is Positive Semidefinite iff its Frobenius Inner Product with any Positive Semidefinite Matrix is Nonnegative]]
